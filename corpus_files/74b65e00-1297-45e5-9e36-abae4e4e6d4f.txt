Summary: This article covers specific information regarding the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) as well as steps and guidelines to making sure your game or app adheres to such requirements.
The Apmetrix SDK allows you to select or disable specific information in your app in order to comply with COPPA guidelines if your game or app is subject to such.
For more information on what is COPPA and whether or not your game or app is subject to such limited information collection you can read more about it here.
The primary goal of COPPA is to control the information that is collected from young children online.  While COPPA outlines some specific limitations, they also allow each developer/publisher some control on what they collect, so long as they disclose they are collecting it. 
For basic COPPA Compliance you will need to pass into our Init function the NO_GEO_LOOKUP, which prevents the device from doing a long/lat lookup, and also prevents it from sending our servers any location data.
The rest of the following flags are optional based on your level of compliance and disclosure (we recommend you read and understand COPPA before making your decisions).
NO_GEO_LOOKUP
NO_IP_LOOKUP
Enabling this flag will cause the SDK to NOT collect the devices IP Address and also prevents the server from looking up information based on a users IP address.
NO_UDID
CHILD_SAFE
Enabling this flag will cause the SDK to NOT collect the following; OpenUDID, IDFA (iOS) Android ID (Android), Latitude/Longitude and IP Address.
NO_GEO_LOOKUP
NO_IP_LOOKUP
Enabling this flag will cause the SDK to NOT collect the devices IP Address and also prevents the server from looking up information based on a users IP address.
NO_UDID
CHILD_SAFE
Enabling this flag will cause the SDK to NOT collect the following; OpenUDID, IDFA (iOS) Android ID (Android), Latitude/Longitude and IP Address.
Note 1: The appDataset and appUnifier can be found in the dashboard under Tasks->Administration->Accounts and expanding Datasets, then select your Dataset.
Note 2: If needing to initialize the session with non-default permissions you can select from any combination of the following options. If more than one option is desired the options can be “OR’d” together using the “|” character:
 (201) Apmetrix_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENTS
 (202) Apmetrix_ERROR_APP_CONFIG
Operation could not be completed because there was a device configuration issue (i.e. missing manifest permissions, device parameters disabled, etc.).  Check the log files to see the specific.
 (203) Apmetrix_ERROR_EVENT_DROPPED
Operation could not be completed due to a database or server error causing internal buffers to reach their maximum capacity.  Check the log files for information on the specific error.
 (204 Apmetrix_ERROR_FAILED
Operation could not be completed because of some other error.  Check the log files for information on the specific error.
