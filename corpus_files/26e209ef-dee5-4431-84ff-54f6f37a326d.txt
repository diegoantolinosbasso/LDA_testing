I'm in a similar situation. But a while back I had someone, run a red light clipping the front of my car, I decided to get one after then.

How do they work exactly? Like do they continuously record or do they only activate after a certain criteria? How large an SD card should I have?
  (0 children)
They overwrite the beginning of the record every once in a while. There's a button you can press shortly after an event so it never gets deleted. A 32gb SD card (pretty standard today) will get you plenty of space.

You can find them at any car related shop, usually just suctions to your windscreen and probably only needs an SD card for memory.

How do they work exactly? Like do they continuously record or do they only activate after a certain criteria? How large an SD card should I have?
  (0 children)
They overwrite the beginning of the record every once in a while. There's a button you can press shortly after an event so it never gets deleted. A 32gb SD card (pretty standard today) will get you plenty of space.

Actually, in his defense, it's really alarming how many reviews out there are fake/paid. "Lots" would possibly need to be in the thousands to overcome those.

Shh don't let anyone know! I'll lose my job (seriously through, gopro is overpriced for a dashcam, I use Kapture)
  (6 children)
Do you have a rear facing one too? I have been thinking of setting up dash cams in my car as well
  (0 children)
I haven't got around to getting a rear one, I was going to get one that can double as a reversing cam, but that requires a bit more money that I'm short on.
https://dashcamtalk.com/
If you want something stealthy, I'd go for a mobius or a B118. Or if you just want something cheap, a G1W/C/H. Currently, no good dual cam dashcams, you're better off using two separate ones
  (1 child)
I was thinking of doing a rear-facing one too. I notice a lot of people in my rear-view way too entranced with their phones.
  (0 children)
I thought about this as well, but if someone runs into your rear, they'll usually be at fault for not keeping proper distance. But I'm a broke graduate student, so my return on investment calculations are pretty lean.
  (1 child)
I do and it was a great idea. I've been almost run of the road by tailgaters when I was daring to drive the speed limit and not 15 over. I've considered putting camera on each side too because I've been almost sideswiped several times but the front and rear cameras can't capture that.
  (2 children)
I use a gopro as a dashcam, but only because I have a gopro already and I haven't bought a proper dashcam yet. It works for now, although I'll never get that mount off my dashboard now I've superglued it in place
  (1 child)
Typically, dash cams (good ones anyway) have features gopros wouldn't have like a built in speedometer, GPS logging, and and auto on/off while parked (turns on when motion is detected)
  (0 children)
Yeah I got a transcend one for Xmas which I need to set up, with the Gopro is ha e to turn it on and put it on its mount then press record and sometimes it wouldn't turn on, sometimes it would freeze on the on screen etc. Happy to have this new one.
I remember first seeing dashcam ob this show in the UK called The Gadget Show. She had it hooked to her rear view mirror and had to press a button to start recording when something happened... As though that would ever work in a crash
  (0 children)
I can attest to that. Shit battery life, crap night video quality, and annoying to have on a micro USB  tether
  (0 children)
Thats like using Grey Goose in an LIT. You don't need it in 4K, save yourself the trouble and get one of the relatively cameras that are designed for this.

Well I've been driving for 16 years and haven't needed one. Not saying they come in handy if needed but it's not like an absolute necessity to drive.

I'm in a similar situation. But a while back I had someone, run a red light clipping the front of my car, I decided to get one after then.

That's if you're going in front of the court for a civil or criminal case. Most insurance claims fortunately don't go through justice.

This is the main reason that insurers don't want them made mandatory. Half the time it would work against them, and worse, it would reduce the proportion of incidents being settled on a 50-50 basis with both parties at fault (more profitable for both insurance companies overall, as everyone's premiums go up).
I understand where your math comes from here, but the odds would be better than 50%, because it would also work for them in cases when people are working to defraud the insurance companies -- it's not simply a zero-sum game between the two insurance companies.
Also, people may drive and/or behave better when they know their actions are being recorded -- another win/win for the insurance companies (and the drivers, really.)
And even in the cases where their insured is at fault and that's what the dashcam shows ... it still saves them money by reducing the time required to investigate, and it probably helps keep cases out of court (which is expensive) when it's clear what happened.
  (0 children)
Yes, I over-simplified a little. However, even without dashcams, only a small proportion of claims are fraudulent, and the proportion that end up in court is smaller still. Most of the time there is simply no contest as to whose fault it was (e.g. if you rear-end someone, it's automatically considered your fault ~99% of the time, for not leaving sufficient stopping distance).

I do and it was a great idea. I've been almost run of the road by tailgaters when I was daring to drive the speed limit and not 15 over. I've considered putting camera on each side too because I've been almost sideswiped several times but the front and rear cameras can't capture that.

Yes, I over-simplified a little. However, even without dashcams, only a small proportion of claims are fraudulent, and the proportion that end up in court is smaller still. Most of the time there is simply no contest as to whose fault it was (e.g. if you rear-end someone, it's automatically considered your fault ~99% of the time, for not leaving sufficient stopping distance).

How do they work exactly? Like do they continuously record or do they only activate after a certain criteria? How large an SD card should I have?
  (0 children)
They overwrite the beginning of the record every once in a while. There's a button you can press shortly after an event so it never gets deleted. A 32gb SD card (pretty standard today) will get you plenty of space.

Actually, in his defense, it's really alarming how many reviews out there are fake/paid. "Lots" would possibly need to be in the thousands to overcome those.

I thought about this as well, but if someone runs into your rear, they'll usually be at fault for not keeping proper distance. But I'm a broke graduate student, so my return on investment calculations are pretty lean.

That's if you're going in front of the court for a civil or criminal case. Most insurance claims fortunately don't go through justice.

If it's your own dashcam, you can just delete the footage and not let the other party know you have a dashcam.
  (7 children)
  (4 children)
  (2 children)
How hard would it be to delete the recording and claim you forgot to turn it on before you drove that day?
  (1 child)
  (0 children)
That's if you're going in front of the court for a civil or criminal case. Most insurance claims fortunately don't go through justice.
  (3 children)
This is the main reason that insurers don't want them made mandatory. Half the time it would work against them, and worse, it would reduce the proportion of incidents being settled on a 50-50 basis with both parties at fault (more profitable for both insurance companies overall, as everyone's premiums go up).
I understand where your math comes from here, but the odds would be better than 50%, because it would also work for them in cases when people are working to defraud the insurance companies -- it's not simply a zero-sum game between the two insurance companies.
Also, people may drive and/or behave better when they know their actions are being recorded -- another win/win for the insurance companies (and the drivers, really.)
And even in the cases where their insured is at fault and that's what the dashcam shows ... it still saves them money by reducing the time required to investigate, and it probably helps keep cases out of court (which is expensive) when it's clear what happened.
  (0 children)
Yes, I over-simplified a little. However, even without dashcams, only a small proportion of claims are fraudulent, and the proportion that end up in court is smaller still. Most of the time there is simply no contest as to whose fault it was (e.g. if you rear-end someone, it's automatically considered your fault ~99% of the time, for not leaving sufficient stopping distance).

They overwrite the beginning of the record every once in a while. There's a button you can press shortly after an event so it never gets deleted. A 32gb SD card (pretty standard today) will get you plenty of space.

Yeah I got a transcend one for Xmas which I need to set up, with the Gopro is ha e to turn it on and put it on its mount then press record and sometimes it wouldn't turn on, sometimes it would freeze on the on screen etc. Happy to have this new one.
I remember first seeing dashcam ob this show in the UK called The Gadget Show. She had it hooked to her rear view mirror and had to press a button to start recording when something happened... As though that would ever work in a crash

It's fairly easy, and I'm not very handy either. Lots of videos out there that can help with installation. I bought one from amazon that has a rear camera as well. Used clear silicone instead of the cheap adhesive for the camera at the back.

I use a gopro as a dashcam, but only because I have a gopro already and I haven't bought a proper dashcam yet. It works for now, although I'll never get that mount off my dashboard now I've superglued it in place
  (1 child)
Typically, dash cams (good ones anyway) have features gopros wouldn't have like a built in speedometer, GPS logging, and and auto on/off while parked (turns on when motion is detected)

Yeah I got a transcend one for Xmas which I need to set up, with the Gopro is ha e to turn it on and put it on its mount then press record and sometimes it wouldn't turn on, sometimes it would freeze on the on screen etc. Happy to have this new one.

I just looked on Amazon, seems highly rated ones are less than $100 and have a small footprint. I guess I should finally get one. I think front and rear are good idea.

Is there a difference between the types? I'm seeing one "E Prance" on Amazon for £40, and a load of similar looking no name ones for half that price!

I leave it turned on when I go to get repairs/service on my car. The result is a roast from the employees that you wouldn't believe. They all talk about how gay you are for having one. What they don't realize is that I can use it for insurance purposes in a sticky situation. Joke is on them.

I do and it was a great idea. I've been almost run of the road by tailgaters when I was daring to drive the speed limit and not 15 over. I've considered putting camera on each side too because I've been almost sideswiped several times but the front and rear cameras can't capture that.

Unless you're a crappy driver.  Then you don't want a dashcam.
If you're a crappy driver, your dashcam is more likely to be used against you than for you.  If the other party or the police notices that you have one ... they'll ask for the footage, and you really don't have any reason to refuse the request, and if it goes to court -- it'll be subpoenaed.

Do you have a rear facing one too? I have been thinking of setting up dash cams in my car as well
  (1 child)
I was thinking of doing a rear-facing one too. I notice a lot of people in my rear-view way too entranced with their phones.
  (0 children)
I thought about this as well, but if someone runs into your rear, they'll usually be at fault for not keeping proper distance. But I'm a broke graduate student, so my return on investment calculations are pretty lean.
  (1 child)
I do and it was a great idea. I've been almost run of the road by tailgaters when I was daring to drive the speed limit and not 15 over. I've considered putting camera on each side too because I've been almost sideswiped several times but the front and rear cameras can't capture that.

If you want something stealthy, I'd go for a mobius or a B118. Or if you just want something cheap, a G1W/C/H. Currently, no good dual cam dashcams, you're better off using two separate ones
  (0 children)
I haven't got around to getting a rear one, I was going to get one that can double as a reversing cam, but that requires a bit more money that I'm short on.

Unless you're a crappy driver.  Then you don't want a dashcam.
If you're a crappy driver, your dashcam is more likely to be used against you than for you.  If the other party or the police notices that you have one ... they'll ask for the footage, and you really don't have any reason to refuse the request, and if it goes to court -- it'll be subpoenaed.

Shh don't let anyone know! I'll lose my job (seriously through, gopro is overpriced for a dashcam, I use Kapture)
  (2 children)
I use a gopro as a dashcam, but only because I have a gopro already and I haven't bought a proper dashcam yet. It works for now, although I'll never get that mount off my dashboard now I've superglued it in place
  (1 child)
Typically, dash cams (good ones anyway) have features gopros wouldn't have like a built in speedometer, GPS logging, and and auto on/off while parked (turns on when motion is detected)
  (0 children)
Yeah I got a transcend one for Xmas which I need to set up, with the Gopro is ha e to turn it on and put it on its mount then press record and sometimes it wouldn't turn on, sometimes it would freeze on the on screen etc. Happy to have this new one.
I remember first seeing dashcam ob this show in the UK called The Gadget Show. She had it hooked to her rear view mirror and had to press a button to start recording when something happened... As though that would ever work in a crash

I have this camera here . It isn't the greatest but I got it experiment with dash cameras. Here is what I know and how this camera works.
First the camera settings can be adjusted. You can turn off the microphone, you can set the screen to turn off after some time when you start driving to keep your from getting distracted or night time driving. The camera automatically starts recording and when the memory card is full it will write over the oldest video, unless, the video is locked by detecting a bump from it's built in sensor. There are various other settings regarding video brightness, quality/resolution, and few other things. Also this camera can take pictures as well by switching it to camera mode in case of accident its a okay back up camera.
The camera came with a charger/power cord. The camera has a built in battery so that once your turn off the car it will keep recording 1,3,or 5 minutes after turning off the car. Also it has a motion detector, if someone walks by it will snap a picture. However this feature does not work from me, I am not sure if its the windshield causing issues, the battery dying too soon, or something else.
What I ended up doing is buying a high amp output charger for USB devices and got a micro USB cord and ran it up to the top of my headliner and placed the camera right next to my rear view mirror.
Overall the camera is good. It's not perfect and its kinda cheap but it does the job. Sometimes I get a sneaking suspicion that it is not recording properly when I occasionally put out the memory card to review the video.
Honestly once you set it up there is not much else you need to do. Just make sure you get a decent camera.

It's fairly easy, and I'm not very handy either. Lots of videos out there that can help with installation. I bought one from amazon that has a rear camera as well. Used clear silicone instead of the cheap adhesive for the camera at the back.

You can find them at any car related shop, usually just suctions to your windscreen and probably only needs an SD card for memory.

Actually, in his defense, it's really alarming how many reviews out there are fake/paid. "Lots" would possibly need to be in the thousands to overcome those.

That's if you're going in front of the court for a civil or criminal case. Most insurance claims fortunately don't go through justice.

How do they work exactly? Like do they continuously record or do they only activate after a certain criteria? How large an SD card should I have?
  (0 children)
They overwrite the beginning of the record every once in a while. There's a button you can press shortly after an event so it never gets deleted. A 32gb SD card (pretty standard today) will get you plenty of space.

I'm in a similar situation. But a while back I had someone, run a red light clipping the front of my car, I decided to get one after then.

I use a gopro as a dashcam, but only because I have a gopro already and I haven't bought a proper dashcam yet. It works for now, although I'll never get that mount off my dashboard now I've superglued it in place

Yeah I got a transcend one for Xmas which I need to set up, with the Gopro is ha e to turn it on and put it on its mount then press record and sometimes it wouldn't turn on, sometimes it would freeze on the on screen etc. Happy to have this new one.
I remember first seeing dashcam ob this show in the UK called The Gadget Show. She had it hooked to her rear view mirror and had to press a button to start recording when something happened... As though that would ever work in a crash
  (6 children)
Do you have a rear facing one too? I have been thinking of setting up dash cams in my car as well
  (1 child)
I was thinking of doing a rear-facing one too. I notice a lot of people in my rear-view way too entranced with their phones.
  (0 children)
I thought about this as well, but if someone runs into your rear, they'll usually be at fault for not keeping proper distance. But I'm a broke graduate student, so my return on investment calculations are pretty lean.

If you want something stealthy, I'd go for a mobius or a B118. Or if you just want something cheap, a G1W/C/H. Currently, no good dual cam dashcams, you're better off using two separate ones
  (1 child)
I do and it was a great idea. I've been almost run of the road by tailgaters when I was daring to drive the speed limit and not 15 over. I've considered putting camera on each side too because I've been almost sideswiped several times but the front and rear cameras can't capture that.
  (0 children)
I haven't got around to getting a rear one, I was going to get one that can double as a reversing cam, but that requires a bit more money that I'm short on.
  (0 children)
I can attest to that. Shit battery life, crap night video quality, and annoying to have on a micro USB  tether
  (0 children)
Thats like using Grey Goose in an LIT. You don't need it in 4K, save yourself the trouble and get one of the relatively cameras that are designed for this.

Unless you're a crappy driver.  Then you don't want a dashcam.
If you're a crappy driver, your dashcam is more likely to be used against you than for you.  If the other party or the police notices that you have one ... they'll ask for the footage, and you really don't have any reason to refuse the request, and if it goes to court -- it'll be subpoenaed.

I leave it turned on when I go to get repairs/service on my car. The result is a roast from the employees that you wouldn't believe. They all talk about how gay you are for having one. What they don't realize is that I can use it for insurance purposes in a sticky situation. Joke is on them.
  (1 child)
Of course insurance claims, but they're also useful to you. Ever been in a strange situation in which you wonder how you got your finger stuck in? That weird quiproquo where you don't know what happened and what you didn't see? Watch the tape later and figure it out. It helped me in understanding situations I failed to notice at the right time and not make the same mistake again.
  (1 child)
How do they work exactly? Like do they continuously record or do they only activate after a certain criteria? How large an SD card should I have?
  (0 children)
They overwrite the beginning of the record every once in a while. There's a button you can press shortly after an event so it never gets deleted. A 32gb SD card (pretty standard today) will get you plenty of space.

Well I've been driving for 16 years and haven't needed one. Not saying they come in handy if needed but it's not like an absolute necessity to drive.
  (0 children)
I'm in a similar situation. But a while back I had someone, run a red light clipping the front of my car, I decided to get one after then.

No they aren't. That law restricted a very specific subset of video accident recorders which didn't include the dash cams OP is talking about.

I just looked on Amazon, seems highly rated ones are less than $100 and have a small footprint. I guess I should finally get one. I think front and rear are good idea.

I love my G1W. I haven't had to use it to prove innocence yet, but I have used it a few times to show people the asshats I encounter while driving.
  (3 children)
Is there a difference between the types? I'm seeing one "E Prance" on Amazon for £40, and a load of similar looking no name ones for half that price!

This is the main reason that insurers don't want them made mandatory. Half the time it would work against them, and worse, it would reduce the proportion of incidents being settled on a 50-50 basis with both parties at fault (more profitable for both insurance companies overall, as everyone's premiums go up).
I understand where your math comes from here, but the odds would be better than 50%, because it would also work for them in cases when people are working to defraud the insurance companies -- it's not simply a zero-sum game between the two insurance companies.
Also, people may drive and/or behave better when they know their actions are being recorded -- another win/win for the insurance companies (and the drivers, really.)
And even in the cases where their insured is at fault and that's what the dashcam shows ... it still saves them money by reducing the time required to investigate, and it probably helps keep cases out of court (which is expensive) when it's clear what happened.
  (0 children)
Yes, I over-simplified a little. However, even without dashcams, only a small proportion of claims are fraudulent, and the proportion that end up in court is smaller still. Most of the time there is simply no contest as to whose fault it was (e.g. if you rear-end someone, it's automatically considered your fault ~99% of the time, for not leaving sufficient stopping distance).
  (9 children)
If it's your own dashcam, you can just delete the footage and not let the other party know you have a dashcam.
  (7 children)
  (0 children)
That's if you're going in front of the court for a civil or criminal case. Most insurance claims fortunately don't go through justice.

I have this camera here . It isn't the greatest but I got it experiment with dash cameras. Here is what I know and how this camera works.
First the camera settings can be adjusted. You can turn off the microphone, you can set the screen to turn off after some time when you start driving to keep your from getting distracted or night time driving. The camera automatically starts recording and when the memory card is full it will write over the oldest video, unless, the video is locked by detecting a bump from it's built in sensor. There are various other settings regarding video brightness, quality/resolution, and few other things. Also this camera can take pictures as well by switching it to camera mode in case of accident its a okay back up camera.
The camera came with a charger/power cord. The camera has a built in battery so that once your turn off the car it will keep recording 1,3,or 5 minutes after turning off the car. Also it has a motion detector, if someone walks by it will snap a picture. However this feature does not work from me, I am not sure if its the windshield causing issues, the battery dying too soon, or something else.
What I ended up doing is buying a high amp output charger for USB devices and got a micro USB cord and ran it up to the top of my headliner and placed the camera right next to my rear view mirror.
Overall the camera is good. It's not perfect and its kinda cheap but it does the job. Sometimes I get a sneaking suspicion that it is not recording properly when I occasionally put out the memory card to review the video.
Honestly once you set it up there is not much else you need to do. Just make sure you get a decent camera.
  (0 children)
It's fairly easy, and I'm not very handy either. Lots of videos out there that can help with installation. I bought one from amazon that has a rear camera as well. Used clear silicone instead of the cheap adhesive for the camera at the back.

Actually, in his defense, it's really alarming how many reviews out there are fake/paid. "Lots" would possibly need to be in the thousands to overcome those.

yea thats true... i was kinda just being an ass because its the only way i can make make myself feel better about my abusive father.

You can find them at any car related shop, usually just suctions to your windscreen and probably only needs an SD card for memory.
  (0 children)
I can attest to that. Shit battery life, crap night video quality, and annoying to have on a micro USB  tether

Typically, dash cams (good ones anyway) have features gopros wouldn't have like a built in speedometer, GPS logging, and and auto on/off while parked (turns on when motion is detected)

Yeah I got a transcend one for Xmas which I need to set up, with the Gopro is ha e to turn it on and put it on its mount then press record and sometimes it wouldn't turn on, sometimes it would freeze on the on screen etc. Happy to have this new one.
I remember first seeing dashcam ob this show in the UK called The Gadget Show. She had it hooked to her rear view mirror and had to press a button to start recording when something happened... As though that would ever work in a crash

Yeah I got a transcend one for Xmas which I need to set up, with the Gopro is ha e to turn it on and put it on its mount then press record and sometimes it wouldn't turn on, sometimes it would freeze on the on screen etc. Happy to have this new one.
I remember first seeing dashcam ob this show in the UK called The Gadget Show. She had it hooked to her rear view mirror and had to press a button to start recording when something happened... As though that would ever work in a crash

Shh don't let anyone know! I'll lose my job (seriously through, gopro is overpriced for a dashcam, I use Kapture)
  (2 children)
I use a gopro as a dashcam, but only because I have a gopro already and I haven't bought a proper dashcam yet. It works for now, although I'll never get that mount off my dashboard now I've superglued it in place
  (1 child)
Typically, dash cams (good ones anyway) have features gopros wouldn't have like a built in speedometer, GPS logging, and and auto on/off while parked (turns on when motion is detected)
  (0 children)
Yeah I got a transcend one for Xmas which I need to set up, with the Gopro is ha e to turn it on and put it on its mount then press record and sometimes it wouldn't turn on, sometimes it would freeze on the on screen etc. Happy to have this new one.
I remember first seeing dashcam ob this show in the UK called The Gadget Show. She had it hooked to her rear view mirror and had to press a button to start recording when something happened... As though that would ever work in a crash
  (6 children)
Do you have a rear facing one too? I have been thinking of setting up dash cams in my car as well
  (1 child)
I was thinking of doing a rear-facing one too. I notice a lot of people in my rear-view way too entranced with their phones.
  (0 children)
I thought about this as well, but if someone runs into your rear, they'll usually be at fault for not keeping proper distance. But I'm a broke graduate student, so my return on investment calculations are pretty lean.
  (1 child)
I do and it was a great idea. I've been almost run of the road by tailgaters when I was daring to drive the speed limit and not 15 over. I've considered putting camera on each side too because I've been almost sideswiped several times but the front and rear cameras can't capture that.
https://dashcamtalk.com/
If you want something stealthy, I'd go for a mobius or a B118. Or if you just want something cheap, a G1W/C/H. Currently, no good dual cam dashcams, you're better off using two separate ones
  (0 children)
I haven't got around to getting a rear one, I was going to get one that can double as a reversing cam, but that requires a bit more money that I'm short on.

That's if you're going in front of the court for a civil or criminal case. Most insurance claims fortunately don't go through justice.

Unless you're a crappy driver.  Then you don't want a dashcam.
If you're a crappy driver, your dashcam is more likely to be used against you than for you.  If the other party or the police notices that you have one ... they'll ask for the footage, and you really don't have any reason to refuse the request, and if it goes to court -- it'll be subpoenaed.

It's fairly easy, and I'm not very handy either. Lots of videos out there that can help with installation. I bought one from amazon that has a rear camera as well. Used clear silicone instead of the cheap adhesive for the camera at the back.

They overwrite the beginning of the record every once in a while. There's a button you can press shortly after an event so it never gets deleted. A 32gb SD card (pretty standard today) will get you plenty of space.

I have this camera here . It isn't the greatest but I got it experiment with dash cameras. Here is what I know and how this camera works.
First the camera settings can be adjusted. You can turn off the microphone, you can set the screen to turn off after some time when you start driving to keep your from getting distracted or night time driving. The camera automatically starts recording and when the memory card is full it will write over the oldest video, unless, the video is locked by detecting a bump from it's built in sensor. There are various other settings regarding video brightness, quality/resolution, and few other things. Also this camera can take pictures as well by switching it to camera mode in case of accident its a okay back up camera.
The camera came with a charger/power cord. The camera has a built in battery so that once your turn off the car it will keep recording 1,3,or 5 minutes after turning off the car. Also it has a motion detector, if someone walks by it will snap a picture. However this feature does not work from me, I am not sure if its the windshield causing issues, the battery dying too soon, or something else.
What I ended up doing is buying a high amp output charger for USB devices and got a micro USB cord and ran it up to the top of my headliner and placed the camera right next to my rear view mirror.
Overall the camera is good. It's not perfect and its kinda cheap but it does the job. Sometimes I get a sneaking suspicion that it is not recording properly when I occasionally put out the memory card to review the video.
Honestly once you set it up there is not much else you need to do. Just make sure you get a decent camera.

Well I've been driving for 16 years and haven't needed one. Not saying they come in handy if needed but it's not like an absolute necessity to drive.

I'm in a similar situation. But a while back I had someone, run a red light clipping the front of my car, I decided to get one after then.

I love my G1W. I haven't had to use it to prove innocence yet, but I have used it a few times to show people the asshats I encounter while driving.

Is there a difference between the types? I'm seeing one "E Prance" on Amazon for £40, and a load of similar looking no name ones for half that price!

I was thinking of doing a rear-facing one too. I notice a lot of people in my rear-view way too entranced with their phones.

I thought about this as well, but if someone runs into your rear, they'll usually be at fault for not keeping proper distance. But I'm a broke graduate student, so my return on investment calculations are pretty lean.

If you want something stealthy, I'd go for a mobius or a B118. Or if you just want something cheap, a G1W/C/H. Currently, no good dual cam dashcams, you're better off using two separate ones
  (1 child)
I do and it was a great idea. I've been almost run of the road by tailgaters when I was daring to drive the speed limit and not 15 over. I've considered putting camera on each side too because I've been almost sideswiped several times but the front and rear cameras can't capture that.
  (0 children)
I haven't got around to getting a rear one, I was going to get one that can double as a reversing cam, but that requires a bit more money that I'm short on.

I use a gopro as a dashcam, but only because I have a gopro already and I haven't bought a proper dashcam yet. It works for now, although I'll never get that mount off my dashboard now I've superglued it in place

Typically, dash cams (good ones anyway) have features gopros wouldn't have like a built in speedometer, GPS logging, and and auto on/off while parked (turns on when motion is detected)

Yeah I got a transcend one for Xmas which I need to set up, with the Gopro is ha e to turn it on and put it on its mount then press record and sometimes it wouldn't turn on, sometimes it would freeze on the on screen etc. Happy to have this new one.
I remember first seeing dashcam ob this show in the UK called The Gadget Show. She had it hooked to her rear view mirror and had to press a button to start recording when something happened... As though that would ever work in a crash

Yeah I got a transcend one for Xmas which I need to set up, with the Gopro is ha e to turn it on and put it on its mount then press record and sometimes it wouldn't turn on, sometimes it would freeze on the on screen etc. Happy to have this new one.
I remember first seeing dashcam ob this show in the UK called The Gadget Show. She had it hooked to her rear view mirror and had to press a button to start recording when something happened... As though that would ever work in a crash

If you want something stealthy, I'd go for a mobius or a B118. Or if you just want something cheap, a G1W/C/H. Currently, no good dual cam dashcams, you're better off using two separate ones

Unless you're a crappy driver.  Then you don't want a dashcam.
If you're a crappy driver, your dashcam is more likely to be used against you than for you.  If the other party or the police notices that you have one ... they'll ask for the footage, and you really don't have any reason to refuse the request, and if it goes to court -- it'll be subpoenaed.

I do and it was a great idea. I've been almost run of the road by tailgaters when I was daring to drive the speed limit and not 15 over. I've considered putting camera on each side too because I've been almost sideswiped several times but the front and rear cameras can't capture that.

I use a gopro as a dashcam, but only because I have a gopro already and I haven't bought a proper dashcam yet. It works for now, although I'll never get that mount off my dashboard now I've superglued it in place
  (1 child)
Typically, dash cams (good ones anyway) have features gopros wouldn't have like a built in speedometer, GPS logging, and and auto on/off while parked (turns on when motion is detected)

Yeah I got a transcend one for Xmas which I need to set up, with the Gopro is ha e to turn it on and put it on its mount then press record and sometimes it wouldn't turn on, sometimes it would freeze on the on screen etc. Happy to have this new one.
I remember first seeing dashcam ob this show in the UK called The Gadget Show. She had it hooked to her rear view mirror and had to press a button to start recording when something happened... As though that would ever work in a crash

I just looked on Amazon, seems highly rated ones are less than $100 and have a small footprint. I guess I should finally get one. I think front and rear are good idea.

I just looked on Amazon, seems highly rated ones are less than $100 and have a small footprint. I guess I should finally get one. I think front and rear are good idea.

No they aren't. That law restricted a very specific subset of video accident recorders which didn't include the dash cams OP is talking about.

I understand where your math comes from here, but the odds would be better than 50%, because it would also work for them in cases when people are working to defraud the insurance companies -- it's not simply a zero-sum game between the two insurance companies.
Also, people may drive and/or behave better when they know their actions are being recorded -- another win/win for the insurance companies (and the drivers, really.)
And even in the cases where their insured is at fault and that's what the dashcam shows ... it still saves them money by reducing the time required to investigate, and it probably helps keep cases out of court (which is expensive) when it's clear what happened.
  (0 children)
Yes, I over-simplified a little. However, even without dashcams, only a small proportion of claims are fraudulent, and the proportion that end up in court is smaller still. Most of the time there is simply no contest as to whose fault it was (e.g. if you rear-end someone, it's automatically considered your fault ~99% of the time, for not leaving sufficient stopping distance).

Shh don't let anyone know! I'll lose my job (seriously through, gopro is overpriced for a dashcam, I use Kapture)
  (6 children)
Do you have a rear facing one too? I have been thinking of setting up dash cams in my car as well
  (0 children)
I haven't got around to getting a rear one, I was going to get one that can double as a reversing cam, but that requires a bit more money that I'm short on.
https://dashcamtalk.com/
If you want something stealthy, I'd go for a mobius or a B118. Or if you just want something cheap, a G1W/C/H. Currently, no good dual cam dashcams, you're better off using two separate ones
  (1 child)
I was thinking of doing a rear-facing one too. I notice a lot of people in my rear-view way too entranced with their phones.
  (0 children)
I thought about this as well, but if someone runs into your rear, they'll usually be at fault for not keeping proper distance. But I'm a broke graduate student, so my return on investment calculations are pretty lean.
  (1 child)
I do and it was a great idea. I've been almost run of the road by tailgaters when I was daring to drive the speed limit and not 15 over. I've considered putting camera on each side too because I've been almost sideswiped several times but the front and rear cameras can't capture that.
  (2 children)
I use a gopro as a dashcam, but only because I have a gopro already and I haven't bought a proper dashcam yet. It works for now, although I'll never get that mount off my dashboard now I've superglued it in place
  (1 child)
Typically, dash cams (good ones anyway) have features gopros wouldn't have like a built in speedometer, GPS logging, and and auto on/off while parked (turns on when motion is detected)
  (0 children)
Yeah I got a transcend one for Xmas which I need to set up, with the Gopro is ha e to turn it on and put it on its mount then press record and sometimes it wouldn't turn on, sometimes it would freeze on the on screen etc. Happy to have this new one.
I remember first seeing dashcam ob this show in the UK called The Gadget Show. She had it hooked to her rear view mirror and had to press a button to start recording when something happened... As though that would ever work in a crash

I have this camera here . It isn't the greatest but I got it experiment with dash cameras. Here is what I know and how this camera works.
First the camera settings can be adjusted. You can turn off the microphone, you can set the screen to turn off after some time when you start driving to keep your from getting distracted or night time driving. The camera automatically starts recording and when the memory card is full it will write over the oldest video, unless, the video is locked by detecting a bump from it's built in sensor. There are various other settings regarding video brightness, quality/resolution, and few other things. Also this camera can take pictures as well by switching it to camera mode in case of accident its a okay back up camera.
The camera came with a charger/power cord. The camera has a built in battery so that once your turn off the car it will keep recording 1,3,or 5 minutes after turning off the car. Also it has a motion detector, if someone walks by it will snap a picture. However this feature does not work from me, I am not sure if its the windshield causing issues, the battery dying too soon, or something else.
What I ended up doing is buying a high amp output charger for USB devices and got a micro USB cord and ran it up to the top of my headliner and placed the camera right next to my rear view mirror.
Overall the camera is good. It's not perfect and its kinda cheap but it does the job. Sometimes I get a sneaking suspicion that it is not recording properly when I occasionally put out the memory card to review the video.
Honestly once you set it up there is not much else you need to do. Just make sure you get a decent camera.

How do they work exactly? Like do they continuously record or do they only activate after a certain criteria? How large an SD card should I have?
  (0 children)
They overwrite the beginning of the record every once in a while. There's a button you can press shortly after an event so it never gets deleted. A 32gb SD card (pretty standard today) will get you plenty of space.

This is the main reason that insurers don't want them made mandatory. Half the time it would work against them, and worse, it would reduce the proportion of incidents being settled on a 50-50 basis with both parties at fault (more profitable for both insurance companies overall, as everyone's premiums go up).
I understand where your math comes from here, but the odds would be better than 50%, because it would also work for them in cases when people are working to defraud the insurance companies -- it's not simply a zero-sum game between the two insurance companies.
Also, people may drive and/or behave better when they know their actions are being recorded -- another win/win for the insurance companies (and the drivers, really.)
And even in the cases where their insured is at fault and that's what the dashcam shows ... it still saves them money by reducing the time required to investigate, and it probably helps keep cases out of court (which is expensive) when it's clear what happened.
  (0 children)
Yes, I over-simplified a little. However, even without dashcams, only a small proportion of claims are fraudulent, and the proportion that end up in court is smaller still. Most of the time there is simply no contest as to whose fault it was (e.g. if you rear-end someone, it's automatically considered your fault ~99% of the time, for not leaving sufficient stopping distance).

That's if you're going in front of the court for a civil or criminal case. Most insurance claims fortunately don't go through justice.

Yeah I got a transcend one for Xmas which I need to set up, with the Gopro is ha e to turn it on and put it on its mount then press record and sometimes it wouldn't turn on, sometimes it would freeze on the on screen etc. Happy to have this new one.
I remember first seeing dashcam ob this show in the UK called The Gadget Show. She had it hooked to her rear view mirror and had to press a button to start recording when something happened... As though that would ever work in a crash

It's fairly easy, and I'm not very handy either. Lots of videos out there that can help with installation. I bought one from amazon that has a rear camera as well. Used clear silicone instead of the cheap adhesive for the camera at the back.

If it's your own dashcam, you can just delete the footage and not let the other party know you have a dashcam.

That's if you're going in front of the court for a civil or criminal case. Most insurance claims fortunately don't go through justice.
  (3 children)
This is the main reason that insurers don't want them made mandatory. Half the time it would work against them, and worse, it would reduce the proportion of incidents being settled on a 50-50 basis with both parties at fault (more profitable for both insurance companies overall, as everyone's premiums go up).
I understand where your math comes from here, but the odds would be better than 50%, because it would also work for them in cases when people are working to defraud the insurance companies -- it's not simply a zero-sum game between the two insurance companies.
Also, people may drive and/or behave better when they know their actions are being recorded -- another win/win for the insurance companies (and the drivers, really.)
And even in the cases where their insured is at fault and that's what the dashcam shows ... it still saves them money by reducing the time required to investigate, and it probably helps keep cases out of court (which is expensive) when it's clear what happened.
  (0 children)
Yes, I over-simplified a little. However, even without dashcams, only a small proportion of claims are fraudulent, and the proportion that end up in court is smaller still. Most of the time there is simply no contest as to whose fault it was (e.g. if you rear-end someone, it's automatically considered your fault ~99% of the time, for not leaving sufficient stopping distance).

Yes, I over-simplified a little. However, even without dashcams, only a small proportion of claims are fraudulent, and the proportion that end up in court is smaller still. Most of the time there is simply no contest as to whose fault it was (e.g. if you rear-end someone, it's automatically considered your fault ~99% of the time, for not leaving sufficient stopping distance).

Yes, I over-simplified a little. However, even without dashcams, only a small proportion of claims are fraudulent, and the proportion that end up in court is smaller still. Most of the time there is simply no contest as to whose fault it was (e.g. if you rear-end someone, it's automatically considered your fault ~99% of the time, for not leaving sufficient stopping distance).

Typically, dash cams (good ones anyway) have features gopros wouldn't have like a built in speedometer, GPS logging, and and auto on/off while parked (turns on when motion is detected)

Yeah I got a transcend one for Xmas which I need to set up, with the Gopro is ha e to turn it on and put it on its mount then press record and sometimes it wouldn't turn on, sometimes it would freeze on the on screen etc. Happy to have this new one.
I remember first seeing dashcam ob this show in the UK called The Gadget Show. She had it hooked to her rear view mirror and had to press a button to start recording when something happened... As though that would ever work in a crash

Actually, in his defense, it's really alarming how many reviews out there are fake/paid. "Lots" would possibly need to be in the thousands to overcome those.

Do you have a rear facing one too? I have been thinking of setting up dash cams in my car as well
  (0 children)
I haven't got around to getting a rear one, I was going to get one that can double as a reversing cam, but that requires a bit more money that I'm short on.
https://dashcamtalk.com/
If you want something stealthy, I'd go for a mobius or a B118. Or if you just want something cheap, a G1W/C/H. Currently, no good dual cam dashcams, you're better off using two separate ones
  (1 child)
I was thinking of doing a rear-facing one too. I notice a lot of people in my rear-view way too entranced with their phones.
  (0 children)
I thought about this as well, but if someone runs into your rear, they'll usually be at fault for not keeping proper distance. But I'm a broke graduate student, so my return on investment calculations are pretty lean.
  (1 child)
I do and it was a great idea. I've been almost run of the road by tailgaters when I was daring to drive the speed limit and not 15 over. I've considered putting camera on each side too because I've been almost sideswiped several times but the front and rear cameras can't capture that.

I just looked on Amazon, seems highly rated ones are less than $100 and have a small footprint. I guess I should finally get one. I think front and rear are good idea.

Actually, in his defense, it's really alarming how many reviews out there are fake/paid. "Lots" would possibly need to be in the thousands to overcome those.

I leave it turned on when I go to get repairs/service on my car. The result is a roast from the employees that you wouldn't believe. They all talk about how gay you are for having one. What they don't realize is that I can use it for insurance purposes in a sticky situation. Joke is on them.

You can find them at any car related shop, usually just suctions to your windscreen and probably only needs an SD card for memory.

It's fairly easy, and I'm not very handy either. Lots of videos out there that can help with installation. I bought one from amazon that has a rear camera as well. Used clear silicone instead of the cheap adhesive for the camera at the back.
  (0 children)
I have this camera here . It isn't the greatest but I got it experiment with dash cameras. Here is what I know and how this camera works.
First the camera settings can be adjusted. You can turn off the microphone, you can set the screen to turn off after some time when you start driving to keep your from getting distracted or night time driving. The camera automatically starts recording and when the memory card is full it will write over the oldest video, unless, the video is locked by detecting a bump from it's built in sensor. There are various other settings regarding video brightness, quality/resolution, and few other things. Also this camera can take pictures as well by switching it to camera mode in case of accident its a okay back up camera.
The camera came with a charger/power cord. The camera has a built in battery so that once your turn off the car it will keep recording 1,3,or 5 minutes after turning off the car. Also it has a motion detector, if someone walks by it will snap a picture. However this feature does not work from me, I am not sure if its the windshield causing issues, the battery dying too soon, or something else.
What I ended up doing is buying a high amp output charger for USB devices and got a micro USB cord and ran it up to the top of my headliner and placed the camera right next to my rear view mirror.
Overall the camera is good. It's not perfect and its kinda cheap but it does the job. Sometimes I get a sneaking suspicion that it is not recording properly when I occasionally put out the memory card to review the video.
Honestly once you set it up there is not much else you need to do. Just make sure you get a decent camera.

If you want something stealthy, I'd go for a mobius or a B118. Or if you just want something cheap, a G1W/C/H. Currently, no good dual cam dashcams, you're better off using two separate ones

I was thinking of doing a rear-facing one too. I notice a lot of people in my rear-view way too entranced with their phones.

I thought about this as well, but if someone runs into your rear, they'll usually be at fault for not keeping proper distance. But I'm a broke graduate student, so my return on investment calculations are pretty lean.

If you want something stealthy, I'd go for a mobius or a B118. Or if you just want something cheap, a G1W/C/H. Currently, no good dual cam dashcams, you're better off using two separate ones

I use a gopro as a dashcam, but only because I have a gopro already and I haven't bought a proper dashcam yet. It works for now, although I'll never get that mount off my dashboard now I've superglued it in place
  (1 child)
Typically, dash cams (good ones anyway) have features gopros wouldn't have like a built in speedometer, GPS logging, and and auto on/off while parked (turns on when motion is detected)
  (0 children)
Yeah I got a transcend one for Xmas which I need to set up, with the Gopro is ha e to turn it on and put it on its mount then press record and sometimes it wouldn't turn on, sometimes it would freeze on the on screen etc. Happy to have this new one.
I remember first seeing dashcam ob this show in the UK called The Gadget Show. She had it hooked to her rear view mirror and had to press a button to start recording when something happened... As though that would ever work in a crash

I use a gopro as a dashcam, but only because I have a gopro already and I haven't bought a proper dashcam yet. It works for now, although I'll never get that mount off my dashboard now I've superglued it in place
  (1 child)
Typically, dash cams (good ones anyway) have features gopros wouldn't have like a built in speedometer, GPS logging, and and auto on/off while parked (turns on when motion is detected)

Yeah I got a transcend one for Xmas which I need to set up, with the Gopro is ha e to turn it on and put it on its mount then press record and sometimes it wouldn't turn on, sometimes it would freeze on the on screen etc. Happy to have this new one.
I remember first seeing dashcam ob this show in the UK called The Gadget Show. She had it hooked to her rear view mirror and had to press a button to start recording when something happened... As though that would ever work in a crash

If you want something stealthy, I'd go for a mobius or a B118. Or if you just want something cheap, a G1W/C/H. Currently, no good dual cam dashcams, you're better off using two separate ones

That's if you're going in front of the court for a civil or criminal case. Most insurance claims fortunately don't go through justice.

I understand where your math comes from here, but the odds would be better than 50%, because it would also work for them in cases when people are working to defraud the insurance companies -- it's not simply a zero-sum game between the two insurance companies.
Also, people may drive and/or behave better when they know their actions are being recorded -- another win/win for the insurance companies (and the drivers, really.)
And even in the cases where their insured is at fault and that's what the dashcam shows ... it still saves them money by reducing the time required to investigate, and it probably helps keep cases out of court (which is expensive) when it's clear what happened.
  (0 children)
Yes, I over-simplified a little. However, even without dashcams, only a small proportion of claims are fraudulent, and the proportion that end up in court is smaller still. Most of the time there is simply no contest as to whose fault it was (e.g. if you rear-end someone, it's automatically considered your fault ~99% of the time, for not leaving sufficient stopping distance).

I use a gopro as a dashcam, but only because I have a gopro already and I haven't bought a proper dashcam yet. It works for now, although I'll never get that mount off my dashboard now I've superglued it in place
  (1 child)
Typically, dash cams (good ones anyway) have features gopros wouldn't have like a built in speedometer, GPS logging, and and auto on/off while parked (turns on when motion is detected)

Yeah I got a transcend one for Xmas which I need to set up, with the Gopro is ha e to turn it on and put it on its mount then press record and sometimes it wouldn't turn on, sometimes it would freeze on the on screen etc. Happy to have this new one.
I remember first seeing dashcam ob this show in the UK called The Gadget Show. She had it hooked to her rear view mirror and had to press a button to start recording when something happened... As though that would ever work in a crash

Of course insurance claims, but they're also useful to you. Ever been in a strange situation in which you wonder how you got your finger stuck in? That weird quiproquo where you don't know what happened and what you didn't see? Watch the tape later and figure it out. It helped me in understanding situations I failed to notice at the right time and not make the same mistake again.

They overwrite the beginning of the record every once in a while. There's a button you can press shortly after an event so it never gets deleted. A 32gb SD card (pretty standard today) will get you plenty of space.

I have this camera here . It isn't the greatest but I got it experiment with dash cameras. Here is what I know and how this camera works.
First the camera settings can be adjusted. You can turn off the microphone, you can set the screen to turn off after some time when you start driving to keep your from getting distracted or night time driving. The camera automatically starts recording and when the memory card is full it will write over the oldest video, unless, the video is locked by detecting a bump from it's built in sensor. There are various other settings regarding video brightness, quality/resolution, and few other things. Also this camera can take pictures as well by switching it to camera mode in case of accident its a okay back up camera.
The camera came with a charger/power cord. The camera has a built in battery so that once your turn off the car it will keep recording 1,3,or 5 minutes after turning off the car. Also it has a motion detector, if someone walks by it will snap a picture. However this feature does not work from me, I am not sure if its the windshield causing issues, the battery dying too soon, or something else.
What I ended up doing is buying a high amp output charger for USB devices and got a micro USB cord and ran it up to the top of my headliner and placed the camera right next to my rear view mirror.
Overall the camera is good. It's not perfect and its kinda cheap but it does the job. Sometimes I get a sneaking suspicion that it is not recording properly when I occasionally put out the memory card to review the video.
Honestly once you set it up there is not much else you need to do. Just make sure you get a decent camera.

It's fairly easy, and I'm not very handy either. Lots of videos out there that can help with installation. I bought one from amazon that has a rear camera as well. Used clear silicone instead of the cheap adhesive for the camera at the back.

yea thats true... i was kinda just being an ass because its the only way i can make make myself feel better about my abusive father.

You can find them at any car related shop, usually just suctions to your windscreen and probably only needs an SD card for memory.

Actually, in his defense, it's really alarming how many reviews out there are fake/paid. "Lots" would possibly need to be in the thousands to overcome those.

I love my G1W. I haven't had to use it to prove innocence yet, but I have used it a few times to show people the asshats I encounter while driving.
  (3 children)
Is there a difference between the types? I'm seeing one "E Prance" on Amazon for £40, and a load of similar looking no name ones for half that price!

Shh don't let anyone know! I'll lose my job (seriously through, gopro is overpriced for a dashcam, I use Kapture)
  (2 children)
I use a gopro as a dashcam, but only because I have a gopro already and I haven't bought a proper dashcam yet. It works for now, although I'll never get that mount off my dashboard now I've superglued it in place
  (1 child)
Typically, dash cams (good ones anyway) have features gopros wouldn't have like a built in speedometer, GPS logging, and and auto on/off while parked (turns on when motion is detected)
  (0 children)
Yeah I got a transcend one for Xmas which I need to set up, with the Gopro is ha e to turn it on and put it on its mount then press record and sometimes it wouldn't turn on, sometimes it would freeze on the on screen etc. Happy to have this new one.
I remember first seeing dashcam ob this show in the UK called The Gadget Show. She had it hooked to her rear view mirror and had to press a button to start recording when something happened... As though that would ever work in a crash
  (6 children)
Do you have a rear facing one too? I have been thinking of setting up dash cams in my car as well
  (1 child)
I was thinking of doing a rear-facing one too. I notice a lot of people in my rear-view way too entranced with their phones.
  (0 children)
I thought about this as well, but if someone runs into your rear, they'll usually be at fault for not keeping proper distance. But I'm a broke graduate student, so my return on investment calculations are pretty lean.
https://dashcamtalk.com/
If you want something stealthy, I'd go for a mobius or a B118. Or if you just want something cheap, a G1W/C/H. Currently, no good dual cam dashcams, you're better off using two separate ones
  (1 child)
I do and it was a great idea. I've been almost run of the road by tailgaters when I was daring to drive the speed limit and not 15 over. I've considered putting camera on each side too because I've been almost sideswiped several times but the front and rear cameras can't capture that.
  (0 children)
I haven't got around to getting a rear one, I was going to get one that can double as a reversing cam, but that requires a bit more money that I'm short on.
  (0 children)
I can attest to that. Shit battery life, crap night video quality, and annoying to have on a micro USB  tether
  (0 children)
Thats like using Grey Goose in an LIT. You don't need it in 4K, save yourself the trouble and get one of the relatively cameras that are designed for this.

If it's your own dashcam, you can just delete the footage and not let the other party know you have a dashcam.

How hard would it be to delete the recording and claim you forgot to turn it on before you drove that day?

That's if you're going in front of the court for a civil or criminal case. Most insurance claims fortunately don't go through justice.
  (3 children)
This is the main reason that insurers don't want them made mandatory. Half the time it would work against them, and worse, it would reduce the proportion of incidents being settled on a 50-50 basis with both parties at fault (more profitable for both insurance companies overall, as everyone's premiums go up).
I understand where your math comes from here, but the odds would be better than 50%, because it would also work for them in cases when people are working to defraud the insurance companies -- it's not simply a zero-sum game between the two insurance companies.
Also, people may drive and/or behave better when they know their actions are being recorded -- another win/win for the insurance companies (and the drivers, really.)
And even in the cases where their insured is at fault and that's what the dashcam shows ... it still saves them money by reducing the time required to investigate, and it probably helps keep cases out of court (which is expensive) when it's clear what happened.
  (0 children)
Yes, I over-simplified a little. However, even without dashcams, only a small proportion of claims are fraudulent, and the proportion that end up in court is smaller still. Most of the time there is simply no contest as to whose fault it was (e.g. if you rear-end someone, it's automatically considered your fault ~99% of the time, for not leaving sufficient stopping distance).
  (0 children)
Unless you're a crappy driver.  Then you don't want a dashcam.
If you're a crappy driver, your dashcam is more likely to be used against you than for you.  If the other party or the police notices that you have one ... they'll ask for the footage, and you really don't have any reason to refuse the request, and if it goes to court -- it'll be subpoenaed.
  (0 children)
I leave it turned on when I go to get repairs/service on my car. The result is a roast from the employees that you wouldn't believe. They all talk about how gay you are for having one. What they don't realize is that I can use it for insurance purposes in a sticky situation. Joke is on them.
  (1 child)
How do they work exactly? Like do they continuously record or do they only activate after a certain criteria? How large an SD card should I have?
  (0 children)
They overwrite the beginning of the record every once in a while. There's a button you can press shortly after an event so it never gets deleted. A 32gb SD card (pretty standard today) will get you plenty of space.
  (0 children)
  (0 children)
  (1 child)
Of course insurance claims, but they're also useful to you. Ever been in a strange situation in which you wonder how you got your finger stuck in? That weird quiproquo where you don't know what happened and what you didn't see? Watch the tape later and figure it out. It helped me in understanding situations I failed to notice at the right time and not make the same mistake again.

If my car had a Hayes manual so I could run the power for one, I'd be all over that.

Well I've been driving for 16 years and haven't needed one. Not saying they come in handy if needed but it's not like an absolute necessity to drive.
  (0 children)
I'm in a similar situation. But a while back I had someone, run a red light clipping the front of my car, I decided to get one after then.
  (2 children)
  (0 children)
I just looked on Amazon, seems highly rated ones are less than $100 and have a small footprint. I guess I should finally get one. I think front and rear are good idea.
  (0 children)
No they aren't. That law restricted a very specific subset of video accident recorders which didn't include the dash cams OP is talking about.

Yes, I over-simplified a little. However, even without dashcams, only a small proportion of claims are fraudulent, and the proportion that end up in court is smaller still. Most of the time there is simply no contest as to whose fault it was (e.g. if you rear-end someone, it's automatically considered your fault ~99% of the time, for not leaving sufficient stopping distance).

It's fairly easy, and I'm not very handy either. Lots of videos out there that can help with installation. I bought one from amazon that has a rear camera as well. Used clear silicone instead of the cheap adhesive for the camera at the back.

I love my G1W. I haven't had to use it to prove innocence yet, but I have used it a few times to show people the asshats I encounter while driving.

Is there a difference between the types? I'm seeing one "E Prance" on Amazon for £40, and a load of similar looking no name ones for half that price!

Of course insurance claims, but they're also useful to you. Ever been in a strange situation in which you wonder how you got your finger stuck in? That weird quiproquo where you don't know what happened and what you didn't see? Watch the tape later and figure it out. It helped me in understanding situations I failed to notice at the right time and not make the same mistake again.

I just looked on Amazon, seems highly rated ones are less than $100 and have a small footprint. I guess I should finally get one. I think front and rear are good idea.

Do you have a rear facing one too? I have been thinking of setting up dash cams in my car as well
  (1 child)
I was thinking of doing a rear-facing one too. I notice a lot of people in my rear-view way too entranced with their phones.
  (0 children)
I thought about this as well, but if someone runs into your rear, they'll usually be at fault for not keeping proper distance. But I'm a broke graduate student, so my return on investment calculations are pretty lean.
  (1 child)
I do and it was a great idea. I've been almost run of the road by tailgaters when I was daring to drive the speed limit and not 15 over. I've considered putting camera on each side too because I've been almost sideswiped several times but the front and rear cameras can't capture that.
https://dashcamtalk.com/
If you want something stealthy, I'd go for a mobius or a B118. Or if you just want something cheap, a G1W/C/H. Currently, no good dual cam dashcams, you're better off using two separate ones

I haven't got around to getting a rear one, I was going to get one that can double as a reversing cam, but that requires a bit more money that I'm short on.

Actually, in his defense, it's really alarming how many reviews out there are fake/paid. "Lots" would possibly need to be in the thousands to overcome those.

Shh don't let anyone know! I'll lose my job (seriously through, gopro is overpriced for a dashcam, I use Kapture)
  (2 children)
I use a gopro as a dashcam, but only because I have a gopro already and I haven't bought a proper dashcam yet. It works for now, although I'll never get that mount off my dashboard now I've superglued it in place
  (1 child)
Typically, dash cams (good ones anyway) have features gopros wouldn't have like a built in speedometer, GPS logging, and and auto on/off while parked (turns on when motion is detected)
  (0 children)
Yeah I got a transcend one for Xmas which I need to set up, with the Gopro is ha e to turn it on and put it on its mount then press record and sometimes it wouldn't turn on, sometimes it would freeze on the on screen etc. Happy to have this new one.
I remember first seeing dashcam ob this show in the UK called The Gadget Show. She had it hooked to her rear view mirror and had to press a button to start recording when something happened... As though that would ever work in a crash
  (6 children)
Do you have a rear facing one too? I have been thinking of setting up dash cams in my car as well
  (1 child)
I was thinking of doing a rear-facing one too. I notice a lot of people in my rear-view way too entranced with their phones.
  (0 children)
I thought about this as well, but if someone runs into your rear, they'll usually be at fault for not keeping proper distance. But I'm a broke graduate student, so my return on investment calculations are pretty lean.

If you want something stealthy, I'd go for a mobius or a B118. Or if you just want something cheap, a G1W/C/H. Currently, no good dual cam dashcams, you're better off using two separate ones
  (1 child)
I do and it was a great idea. I've been almost run of the road by tailgaters when I was daring to drive the speed limit and not 15 over. I've considered putting camera on each side too because I've been almost sideswiped several times but the front and rear cameras can't capture that.
  (0 children)
I haven't got around to getting a rear one, I was going to get one that can double as a reversing cam, but that requires a bit more money that I'm short on.

If it's your own dashcam, you can just delete the footage and not let the other party know you have a dashcam.
  (7 children)
  (4 children)
  (2 children)
How hard would it be to delete the recording and claim you forgot to turn it on before you drove that day?
  (1 child)
  (0 children)
That's if you're going in front of the court for a civil or criminal case. Most insurance claims fortunately don't go through justice.
  (3 children)
This is the main reason that insurers don't want them made mandatory. Half the time it would work against them, and worse, it would reduce the proportion of incidents being settled on a 50-50 basis with both parties at fault (more profitable for both insurance companies overall, as everyone's premiums go up).
I understand where your math comes from here, but the odds would be better than 50%, because it would also work for them in cases when people are working to defraud the insurance companies -- it's not simply a zero-sum game between the two insurance companies.
Also, people may drive and/or behave better when they know their actions are being recorded -- another win/win for the insurance companies (and the drivers, really.)
And even in the cases where their insured is at fault and that's what the dashcam shows ... it still saves them money by reducing the time required to investigate, and it probably helps keep cases out of court (which is expensive) when it's clear what happened.
  (0 children)
Yes, I over-simplified a little. However, even without dashcams, only a small proportion of claims are fraudulent, and the proportion that end up in court is smaller still. Most of the time there is simply no contest as to whose fault it was (e.g. if you rear-end someone, it's automatically considered your fault ~99% of the time, for not leaving sufficient stopping distance).

Yes, I over-simplified a little. However, even without dashcams, only a small proportion of claims are fraudulent, and the proportion that end up in court is smaller still. Most of the time there is simply no contest as to whose fault it was (e.g. if you rear-end someone, it's automatically considered your fault ~99% of the time, for not leaving sufficient stopping distance).

If it's your own dashcam, you can just delete the footage and not let the other party know you have a dashcam.
  (7 children)

How hard would it be to delete the recording and claim you forgot to turn it on before you drove that day?
  (1 child)
  (0 children)
That's if you're going in front of the court for a civil or criminal case. Most insurance claims fortunately don't go through justice.
  (3 children)
This is the main reason that insurers don't want them made mandatory. Half the time it would work against them, and worse, it would reduce the proportion of incidents being settled on a 50-50 basis with both parties at fault (more profitable for both insurance companies overall, as everyone's premiums go up).
I understand where your math comes from here, but the odds would be better than 50%, because it would also work for them in cases when people are working to defraud the insurance companies -- it's not simply a zero-sum game between the two insurance companies.
Also, people may drive and/or behave better when they know their actions are being recorded -- another win/win for the insurance companies (and the drivers, really.)
And even in the cases where their insured is at fault and that's what the dashcam shows ... it still saves them money by reducing the time required to investigate, and it probably helps keep cases out of court (which is expensive) when it's clear what happened.
  (0 children)
Yes, I over-simplified a little. However, even without dashcams, only a small proportion of claims are fraudulent, and the proportion that end up in court is smaller still. Most of the time there is simply no contest as to whose fault it was (e.g. if you rear-end someone, it's automatically considered your fault ~99% of the time, for not leaving sufficient stopping distance).

No they aren't. That law restricted a very specific subset of video accident recorders which didn't include the dash cams OP is talking about.

They overwrite the beginning of the record every once in a while. There's a button you can press shortly after an event so it never gets deleted. A 32gb SD card (pretty standard today) will get you plenty of space.

If it's your own dashcam, you can just delete the footage and not let the other party know you have a dashcam.

How hard would it be to delete the recording and claim you forgot to turn it on before you drove that day?

That's if you're going in front of the court for a civil or criminal case. Most insurance claims fortunately don't go through justice.

No they aren't. That law restricted a very specific subset of video accident recorders which didn't include the dash cams OP is talking about.

I just looked on Amazon, seems highly rated ones are less than $100 and have a small footprint. I guess I should finally get one. I think front and rear are good idea.

  (6 children)
Do you have a rear facing one too? I have been thinking of setting up dash cams in my car as well
  (0 children)
I haven't got around to getting a rear one, I was going to get one that can double as a reversing cam, but that requires a bit more money that I'm short on.

You can find them at any car related shop, usually just suctions to your windscreen and probably only needs an SD card for memory.
  (1 child)
Well I've been driving for 16 years and haven't needed one. Not saying they come in handy if needed but it's not like an absolute necessity to drive.
  (0 children)
I'm in a similar situation. But a while back I had someone, run a red light clipping the front of my car, I decided to get one after then.
  (4 children)
I love my G1W. I haven't had to use it to prove innocence yet, but I have used it a few times to show people the asshats I encounter while driving.
Unless you're a crappy driver.  Then you don't want a dashcam.
If you're a crappy driver, your dashcam is more likely to be used against you than for you.  If the other party or the police notices that you have one ... they'll ask for the footage, and you really don't have any reason to refuse the request, and if it goes to court -- it'll be subpoenaed.
  (0 children)
I leave it turned on when I go to get repairs/service on my car. The result is a roast from the employees that you wouldn't believe. They all talk about how gay you are for having one. What they don't realize is that I can use it for insurance purposes in a sticky situation. Joke is on them.
  (0 children)
  (1 child)
How do they work exactly? Like do they continuously record or do they only activate after a certain criteria? How large an SD card should I have?
  (1 child)
Of course insurance claims, but they're also useful to you. Ever been in a strange situation in which you wonder how you got your finger stuck in? That weird quiproquo where you don't know what happened and what you didn't see? Watch the tape later and figure it out. It helped me in understanding situations I failed to notice at the right time and not make the same mistake again.

If my car had a Hayes manual so I could run the power for one, I'd be all over that.

Shh don't let anyone know! I'll lose my job (seriously through, gopro is overpriced for a dashcam, I use Kapture)
  (2 children)
I use a gopro as a dashcam, but only because I have a gopro already and I haven't bought a proper dashcam yet. It works for now, although I'll never get that mount off my dashboard now I've superglued it in place
  (1 child)
Typically, dash cams (good ones anyway) have features gopros wouldn't have like a built in speedometer, GPS logging, and and auto on/off while parked (turns on when motion is detected)
  (0 children)
Yeah I got a transcend one for Xmas which I need to set up, with the Gopro is ha e to turn it on and put it on its mount then press record and sometimes it wouldn't turn on, sometimes it would freeze on the on screen etc. Happy to have this new one.
I remember first seeing dashcam ob this show in the UK called The Gadget Show. She had it hooked to her rear view mirror and had to press a button to start recording when something happened... As though that would ever work in a crash
  (6 children)
Do you have a rear facing one too? I have been thinking of setting up dash cams in my car as well
  (1 child)
I was thinking of doing a rear-facing one too. I notice a lot of people in my rear-view way too entranced with their phones.
  (0 children)
I thought about this as well, but if someone runs into your rear, they'll usually be at fault for not keeping proper distance. But I'm a broke graduate student, so my return on investment calculations are pretty lean.
https://dashcamtalk.com/
If you want something stealthy, I'd go for a mobius or a B118. Or if you just want something cheap, a G1W/C/H. Currently, no good dual cam dashcams, you're better off using two separate ones
  (1 child)
I do and it was a great idea. I've been almost run of the road by tailgaters when I was daring to drive the speed limit and not 15 over. I've considered putting camera on each side too because I've been almost sideswiped several times but the front and rear cameras can't capture that.

I haven't got around to getting a rear one, I was going to get one that can double as a reversing cam, but that requires a bit more money that I'm short on.

I can attest to that. Shit battery life, crap night video quality, and annoying to have on a micro USB  tether

Thats like using Grey Goose in an LIT. You don't need it in 4K, save yourself the trouble and get one of the relatively cameras that are designed for this.

Do you have a rear facing one too? I have been thinking of setting up dash cams in my car as well

If you want something stealthy, I'd go for a mobius or a B118. Or if you just want something cheap, a G1W/C/H. Currently, no good dual cam dashcams, you're better off using two separate ones

I do and it was a great idea. I've been almost run of the road by tailgaters when I was daring to drive the speed limit and not 15 over. I've considered putting camera on each side too because I've been almost sideswiped several times but the front and rear cameras can't capture that.
  (1 child)
I was thinking of doing a rear-facing one too. I notice a lot of people in my rear-view way too entranced with their phones.
  (0 children)
I thought about this as well, but if someone runs into your rear, they'll usually be at fault for not keeping proper distance. But I'm a broke graduate student, so my return on investment calculations are pretty lean.

This is the main reason that insurers don't want them made mandatory. Half the time it would work against them, and worse, it would reduce the proportion of incidents being settled on a 50-50 basis with both parties at fault (more profitable for both insurance companies overall, as everyone's premiums go up).
I understand where your math comes from here, but the odds would be better than 50%, because it would also work for them in cases when people are working to defraud the insurance companies -- it's not simply a zero-sum game between the two insurance companies.
Also, people may drive and/or behave better when they know their actions are being recorded -- another win/win for the insurance companies (and the drivers, really.)
And even in the cases where their insured is at fault and that's what the dashcam shows ... it still saves them money by reducing the time required to investigate, and it probably helps keep cases out of court (which is expensive) when it's clear what happened.
  (0 children)
Yes, I over-simplified a little. However, even without dashcams, only a small proportion of claims are fraudulent, and the proportion that end up in court is smaller still. Most of the time there is simply no contest as to whose fault it was (e.g. if you rear-end someone, it's automatically considered your fault ~99% of the time, for not leaving sufficient stopping distance).
  (9 children)
If it's your own dashcam, you can just delete the footage and not let the other party know you have a dashcam.
  (7 children)
  (0 children)
That's if you're going in front of the court for a civil or criminal case. Most insurance claims fortunately don't go through justice.

How hard would it be to delete the recording and claim you forgot to turn it on before you drove that day?

I just looked on Amazon, seems highly rated ones are less than $100 and have a small footprint. I guess I should finally get one. I think front and rear are good idea.

No they aren't. That law restricted a very specific subset of video accident recorders which didn't include the dash cams OP is talking about.

I use a gopro as a dashcam, but only because I have a gopro already and I haven't bought a proper dashcam yet. It works for now, although I'll never get that mount off my dashboard now I've superglued it in place
  (1 child)
Typically, dash cams (good ones anyway) have features gopros wouldn't have like a built in speedometer, GPS logging, and and auto on/off while parked (turns on when motion is detected)

Yeah I got a transcend one for Xmas which I need to set up, with the Gopro is ha e to turn it on and put it on its mount then press record and sometimes it wouldn't turn on, sometimes it would freeze on the on screen etc. Happy to have this new one.
I remember first seeing dashcam ob this show in the UK called The Gadget Show. She had it hooked to her rear view mirror and had to press a button to start recording when something happened... As though that would ever work in a crash

That's if you're going in front of the court for a civil or criminal case. Most insurance claims fortunately don't go through justice.

No they aren't. That law restricted a very specific subset of video accident recorders which didn't include the dash cams OP is talking about.

Shh don't let anyone know! I'll lose my job (seriously through, gopro is overpriced for a dashcam, I use Kapture)
  (2 children)
I use a gopro as a dashcam, but only because I have a gopro already and I haven't bought a proper dashcam yet. It works for now, although I'll never get that mount off my dashboard now I've superglued it in place
  (1 child)
Typically, dash cams (good ones anyway) have features gopros wouldn't have like a built in speedometer, GPS logging, and and auto on/off while parked (turns on when motion is detected)
  (0 children)
Yeah I got a transcend one for Xmas which I need to set up, with the Gopro is ha e to turn it on and put it on its mount then press record and sometimes it wouldn't turn on, sometimes it would freeze on the on screen etc. Happy to have this new one.
I remember first seeing dashcam ob this show in the UK called The Gadget Show. She had it hooked to her rear view mirror and had to press a button to start recording when something happened... As though that would ever work in a crash
  (6 children)
Do you have a rear facing one too? I have been thinking of setting up dash cams in my car as well
  (1 child)
I was thinking of doing a rear-facing one too. I notice a lot of people in my rear-view way too entranced with their phones.
  (0 children)
I thought about this as well, but if someone runs into your rear, they'll usually be at fault for not keeping proper distance. But I'm a broke graduate student, so my return on investment calculations are pretty lean.
  (1 child)
I do and it was a great idea. I've been almost run of the road by tailgaters when I was daring to drive the speed limit and not 15 over. I've considered putting camera on each side too because I've been almost sideswiped several times but the front and rear cameras can't capture that.
https://dashcamtalk.com/
If you want something stealthy, I'd go for a mobius or a B118. Or if you just want something cheap, a G1W/C/H. Currently, no good dual cam dashcams, you're better off using two separate ones
  (0 children)
I haven't got around to getting a rear one, I was going to get one that can double as a reversing cam, but that requires a bit more money that I'm short on.

Actually, in his defense, it's really alarming how many reviews out there are fake/paid. "Lots" would possibly need to be in the thousands to overcome those.

I have this camera here . It isn't the greatest but I got it experiment with dash cameras. Here is what I know and how this camera works.
First the camera settings can be adjusted. You can turn off the microphone, you can set the screen to turn off after some time when you start driving to keep your from getting distracted or night time driving. The camera automatically starts recording and when the memory card is full it will write over the oldest video, unless, the video is locked by detecting a bump from it's built in sensor. There are various other settings regarding video brightness, quality/resolution, and few other things. Also this camera can take pictures as well by switching it to camera mode in case of accident its a okay back up camera.
The camera came with a charger/power cord. The camera has a built in battery so that once your turn off the car it will keep recording 1,3,or 5 minutes after turning off the car. Also it has a motion detector, if someone walks by it will snap a picture. However this feature does not work from me, I am not sure if its the windshield causing issues, the battery dying too soon, or something else.
What I ended up doing is buying a high amp output charger for USB devices and got a micro USB cord and ran it up to the top of my headliner and placed the camera right next to my rear view mirror.
Overall the camera is good. It's not perfect and its kinda cheap but it does the job. Sometimes I get a sneaking suspicion that it is not recording properly when I occasionally put out the memory card to review the video.
Honestly once you set it up there is not much else you need to do. Just make sure you get a decent camera.

I understand where your math comes from here, but the odds would be better than 50%, because it would also work for them in cases when people are working to defraud the insurance companies -- it's not simply a zero-sum game between the two insurance companies.
Also, people may drive and/or behave better when they know their actions are being recorded -- another win/win for the insurance companies (and the drivers, really.)
And even in the cases where their insured is at fault and that's what the dashcam shows ... it still saves them money by reducing the time required to investigate, and it probably helps keep cases out of court (which is expensive) when it's clear what happened.
  (0 children)
Yes, I over-simplified a little. However, even without dashcams, only a small proportion of claims are fraudulent, and the proportion that end up in court is smaller still. Most of the time there is simply no contest as to whose fault it was (e.g. if you rear-end someone, it's automatically considered your fault ~99% of the time, for not leaving sufficient stopping distance).

Of course insurance claims, but they're also useful to you. Ever been in a strange situation in which you wonder how you got your finger stuck in? That weird quiproquo where you don't know what happened and what you didn't see? Watch the tape later and figure it out. It helped me in understanding situations I failed to notice at the right time and not make the same mistake again.

Of course insurance claims, but they're also useful to you. Ever been in a strange situation in which you wonder how you got your finger stuck in? That weird quiproquo where you don't know what happened and what you didn't see? Watch the tape later and figure it out. It helped me in understanding situations I failed to notice at the right time and not make the same mistake again.

This is the main reason that insurers don't want them made mandatory. Half the time it would work against them, and worse, it would reduce the proportion of incidents being settled on a 50-50 basis with both parties at fault (more profitable for both insurance companies overall, as everyone's premiums go up).
I understand where your math comes from here, but the odds would be better than 50%, because it would also work for them in cases when people are working to defraud the insurance companies -- it's not simply a zero-sum game between the two insurance companies.
Also, people may drive and/or behave better when they know their actions are being recorded -- another win/win for the insurance companies (and the drivers, really.)
And even in the cases where their insured is at fault and that's what the dashcam shows ... it still saves them money by reducing the time required to investigate, and it probably helps keep cases out of court (which is expensive) when it's clear what happened.
  (0 children)
Yes, I over-simplified a little. However, even without dashcams, only a small proportion of claims are fraudulent, and the proportion that end up in court is smaller still. Most of the time there is simply no contest as to whose fault it was (e.g. if you rear-end someone, it's automatically considered your fault ~99% of the time, for not leaving sufficient stopping distance).

I have this camera here . It isn't the greatest but I got it experiment with dash cameras. Here is what I know and how this camera works.
First the camera settings can be adjusted. You can turn off the microphone, you can set the screen to turn off after some time when you start driving to keep your from getting distracted or night time driving. The camera automatically starts recording and when the memory card is full it will write over the oldest video, unless, the video is locked by detecting a bump from it's built in sensor. There are various other settings regarding video brightness, quality/resolution, and few other things. Also this camera can take pictures as well by switching it to camera mode in case of accident its a okay back up camera.
The camera came with a charger/power cord. The camera has a built in battery so that once your turn off the car it will keep recording 1,3,or 5 minutes after turning off the car. Also it has a motion detector, if someone walks by it will snap a picture. However this feature does not work from me, I am not sure if its the windshield causing issues, the battery dying too soon, or something else.
What I ended up doing is buying a high amp output charger for USB devices and got a micro USB cord and ran it up to the top of my headliner and placed the camera right next to my rear view mirror.
Overall the camera is good. It's not perfect and its kinda cheap but it does the job. Sometimes I get a sneaking suspicion that it is not recording properly when I occasionally put out the memory card to review the video.
Honestly once you set it up there is not much else you need to do. Just make sure you get a decent camera.

I thought about this as well, but if someone runs into your rear, they'll usually be at fault for not keeping proper distance. But I'm a broke graduate student, so my return on investment calculations are pretty lean.

Shh don't let anyone know! I'll lose my job (seriously through, gopro is overpriced for a dashcam, I use Kapture)
  (6 children)
Do you have a rear facing one too? I have been thinking of setting up dash cams in my car as well
  (0 children)
I haven't got around to getting a rear one, I was going to get one that can double as a reversing cam, but that requires a bit more money that I'm short on.
https://dashcamtalk.com/
If you want something stealthy, I'd go for a mobius or a B118. Or if you just want something cheap, a G1W/C/H. Currently, no good dual cam dashcams, you're better off using two separate ones
  (1 child)
I do and it was a great idea. I've been almost run of the road by tailgaters when I was daring to drive the speed limit and not 15 over. I've considered putting camera on each side too because I've been almost sideswiped several times but the front and rear cameras can't capture that.
  (1 child)
I was thinking of doing a rear-facing one too. I notice a lot of people in my rear-view way too entranced with their phones.
  (0 children)
I thought about this as well, but if someone runs into your rear, they'll usually be at fault for not keeping proper distance. But I'm a broke graduate student, so my return on investment calculations are pretty lean.
  (2 children)
I use a gopro as a dashcam, but only because I have a gopro already and I haven't bought a proper dashcam yet. It works for now, although I'll never get that mount off my dashboard now I've superglued it in place
  (1 child)
Typically, dash cams (good ones anyway) have features gopros wouldn't have like a built in speedometer, GPS logging, and and auto on/off while parked (turns on when motion is detected)
  (0 children)
Yeah I got a transcend one for Xmas which I need to set up, with the Gopro is ha e to turn it on and put it on its mount then press record and sometimes it wouldn't turn on, sometimes it would freeze on the on screen etc. Happy to have this new one.
I remember first seeing dashcam ob this show in the UK called The Gadget Show. She had it hooked to her rear view mirror and had to press a button to start recording when something happened... As though that would ever work in a crash

I just looked on Amazon, seems highly rated ones are less than $100 and have a small footprint. I guess I should finally get one. I think front and rear are good idea.

Well I've been driving for 16 years and haven't needed one. Not saying they come in handy if needed but it's not like an absolute necessity to drive.

I'm in a similar situation. But a while back I had someone, run a red light clipping the front of my car, I decided to get one after then.

I thought about this as well, but if someone runs into your rear, they'll usually be at fault for not keeping proper distance. But I'm a broke graduate student, so my return on investment calculations are pretty lean.

I was thinking of doing a rear-facing one too. I notice a lot of people in my rear-view way too entranced with their phones.

If you want something stealthy, I'd go for a mobius or a B118. Or if you just want something cheap, a G1W/C/H. Currently, no good dual cam dashcams, you're better off using two separate ones

Shh don't let anyone know! I'll lose my job (seriously through, gopro is overpriced for a dashcam, I use Kapture)
  (2 children)
I use a gopro as a dashcam, but only because I have a gopro already and I haven't bought a proper dashcam yet. It works for now, although I'll never get that mount off my dashboard now I've superglued it in place
  (1 child)
Typically, dash cams (good ones anyway) have features gopros wouldn't have like a built in speedometer, GPS logging, and and auto on/off while parked (turns on when motion is detected)
  (0 children)
Yeah I got a transcend one for Xmas which I need to set up, with the Gopro is ha e to turn it on and put it on its mount then press record and sometimes it wouldn't turn on, sometimes it would freeze on the on screen etc. Happy to have this new one.
I remember first seeing dashcam ob this show in the UK called The Gadget Show. She had it hooked to her rear view mirror and had to press a button to start recording when something happened... As though that would ever work in a crash
  (6 children)
Do you have a rear facing one too? I have been thinking of setting up dash cams in my car as well
  (1 child)
I was thinking of doing a rear-facing one too. I notice a lot of people in my rear-view way too entranced with their phones.
  (0 children)
I thought about this as well, but if someone runs into your rear, they'll usually be at fault for not keeping proper distance. But I'm a broke graduate student, so my return on investment calculations are pretty lean.

If you want something stealthy, I'd go for a mobius or a B118. Or if you just want something cheap, a G1W/C/H. Currently, no good dual cam dashcams, you're better off using two separate ones
  (1 child)
I do and it was a great idea. I've been almost run of the road by tailgaters when I was daring to drive the speed limit and not 15 over. I've considered putting camera on each side too because I've been almost sideswiped several times but the front and rear cameras can't capture that.
  (0 children)
I haven't got around to getting a rear one, I was going to get one that can double as a reversing cam, but that requires a bit more money that I'm short on.
  (0 children)
I can attest to that. Shit battery life, crap night video quality, and annoying to have on a micro USB  tether
  (0 children)
Thats like using Grey Goose in an LIT. You don't need it in 4K, save yourself the trouble and get one of the relatively cameras that are designed for this.

This is the main reason that insurers don't want them made mandatory. Half the time it would work against them, and worse, it would reduce the proportion of incidents being settled on a 50-50 basis with both parties at fault (more profitable for both insurance companies overall, as everyone's premiums go up).
I understand where your math comes from here, but the odds would be better than 50%, because it would also work for them in cases when people are working to defraud the insurance companies -- it's not simply a zero-sum game between the two insurance companies.
Also, people may drive and/or behave better when they know their actions are being recorded -- another win/win for the insurance companies (and the drivers, really.)
And even in the cases where their insured is at fault and that's what the dashcam shows ... it still saves them money by reducing the time required to investigate, and it probably helps keep cases out of court (which is expensive) when it's clear what happened.
  (0 children)
Yes, I over-simplified a little. However, even without dashcams, only a small proportion of claims are fraudulent, and the proportion that end up in court is smaller still. Most of the time there is simply no contest as to whose fault it was (e.g. if you rear-end someone, it's automatically considered your fault ~99% of the time, for not leaving sufficient stopping distance).

No they aren't. That law restricted a very specific subset of video accident recorders which didn't include the dash cams OP is talking about.

I use a gopro as a dashcam, but only because I have a gopro already and I haven't bought a proper dashcam yet. It works for now, although I'll never get that mount off my dashboard now I've superglued it in place
  (1 child)
Typically, dash cams (good ones anyway) have features gopros wouldn't have like a built in speedometer, GPS logging, and and auto on/off while parked (turns on when motion is detected)

Yeah I got a transcend one for Xmas which I need to set up, with the Gopro is ha e to turn it on and put it on its mount then press record and sometimes it wouldn't turn on, sometimes it would freeze on the on screen etc. Happy to have this new one.
I remember first seeing dashcam ob this show in the UK called The Gadget Show. She had it hooked to her rear view mirror and had to press a button to start recording when something happened... As though that would ever work in a crash

I leave it turned on when I go to get repairs/service on my car. The result is a roast from the employees that you wouldn't believe. They all talk about how gay you are for having one. What they don't realize is that I can use it for insurance purposes in a sticky situation. Joke is on them.

Actually, in his defense, it's really alarming how many reviews out there are fake/paid. "Lots" would possibly need to be in the thousands to overcome those.

I leave it turned on when I go to get repairs/service on my car. The result is a roast from the employees that you wouldn't believe. They all talk about how gay you are for having one. What they don't realize is that I can use it for insurance purposes in a sticky situation. Joke is on them.

Well I've been driving for 16 years and haven't needed one. Not saying they come in handy if needed but it's not like an absolute necessity to drive.

I'm in a similar situation. But a while back I had someone, run a red light clipping the front of my car, I decided to get one after then.

I just looked on Amazon, seems highly rated ones are less than $100 and have a small footprint. I guess I should finally get one. I think front and rear are good idea.

I have this camera here . It isn't the greatest but I got it experiment with dash cameras. Here is what I know and how this camera works.
First the camera settings can be adjusted. You can turn off the microphone, you can set the screen to turn off after some time when you start driving to keep your from getting distracted or night time driving. The camera automatically starts recording and when the memory card is full it will write over the oldest video, unless, the video is locked by detecting a bump from it's built in sensor. There are various other settings regarding video brightness, quality/resolution, and few other things. Also this camera can take pictures as well by switching it to camera mode in case of accident its a okay back up camera.
The camera came with a charger/power cord. The camera has a built in battery so that once your turn off the car it will keep recording 1,3,or 5 minutes after turning off the car. Also it has a motion detector, if someone walks by it will snap a picture. However this feature does not work from me, I am not sure if its the windshield causing issues, the battery dying too soon, or something else.
What I ended up doing is buying a high amp output charger for USB devices and got a micro USB cord and ran it up to the top of my headliner and placed the camera right next to my rear view mirror.
Overall the camera is good. It's not perfect and its kinda cheap but it does the job. Sometimes I get a sneaking suspicion that it is not recording properly when I occasionally put out the memory card to review the video.
Honestly once you set it up there is not much else you need to do. Just make sure you get a decent camera.

Do you have a rear facing one too? I have been thinking of setting up dash cams in my car as well
  (1 child)
I was thinking of doing a rear-facing one too. I notice a lot of people in my rear-view way too entranced with their phones.
  (0 children)
I thought about this as well, but if someone runs into your rear, they'll usually be at fault for not keeping proper distance. But I'm a broke graduate student, so my return on investment calculations are pretty lean.
https://dashcamtalk.com/
If you want something stealthy, I'd go for a mobius or a B118. Or if you just want something cheap, a G1W/C/H. Currently, no good dual cam dashcams, you're better off using two separate ones
  (1 child)
I do and it was a great idea. I've been almost run of the road by tailgaters when I was daring to drive the speed limit and not 15 over. I've considered putting camera on each side too because I've been almost sideswiped several times but the front and rear cameras can't capture that.
  (0 children)
I haven't got around to getting a rear one, I was going to get one that can double as a reversing cam, but that requires a bit more money that I'm short on.

I haven't got around to getting a rear one, I was going to get one that can double as a reversing cam, but that requires a bit more money that I'm short on.

I do and it was a great idea. I've been almost run of the road by tailgaters when I was daring to drive the speed limit and not 15 over. I've considered putting camera on each side too because I've been almost sideswiped several times but the front and rear cameras can't capture that.

I use a gopro as a dashcam, but only because I have a gopro already and I haven't bought a proper dashcam yet. It works for now, although I'll never get that mount off my dashboard now I've superglued it in place
  (1 child)
Typically, dash cams (good ones anyway) have features gopros wouldn't have like a built in speedometer, GPS logging, and and auto on/off while parked (turns on when motion is detected)

Yeah I got a transcend one for Xmas which I need to set up, with the Gopro is ha e to turn it on and put it on its mount then press record and sometimes it wouldn't turn on, sometimes it would freeze on the on screen etc. Happy to have this new one.
I remember first seeing dashcam ob this show in the UK called The Gadget Show. She had it hooked to her rear view mirror and had to press a button to start recording when something happened... As though that would ever work in a crash

It's fairly easy, and I'm not very handy either. Lots of videos out there that can help with installation. I bought one from amazon that has a rear camera as well. Used clear silicone instead of the cheap adhesive for the camera at the back.

Yeah I got a transcend one for Xmas which I need to set up, with the Gopro is ha e to turn it on and put it on its mount then press record and sometimes it wouldn't turn on, sometimes it would freeze on the on screen etc. Happy to have this new one.
I remember first seeing dashcam ob this show in the UK called The Gadget Show. She had it hooked to her rear view mirror and had to press a button to start recording when something happened... As though that would ever work in a crash

Of course insurance claims, but they're also useful to you. Ever been in a strange situation in which you wonder how you got your finger stuck in? That weird quiproquo where you don't know what happened and what you didn't see? Watch the tape later and figure it out. It helped me in understanding situations I failed to notice at the right time and not make the same mistake again.

You can find them at any car related shop, usually just suctions to your windscreen and probably only needs an SD card for memory.

I have this camera here . It isn't the greatest but I got it experiment with dash cameras. Here is what I know and how this camera works.
First the camera settings can be adjusted. You can turn off the microphone, you can set the screen to turn off after some time when you start driving to keep your from getting distracted or night time driving. The camera automatically starts recording and when the memory card is full it will write over the oldest video, unless, the video is locked by detecting a bump from it's built in sensor. There are various other settings regarding video brightness, quality/resolution, and few other things. Also this camera can take pictures as well by switching it to camera mode in case of accident its a okay back up camera.
The camera came with a charger/power cord. The camera has a built in battery so that once your turn off the car it will keep recording 1,3,or 5 minutes after turning off the car. Also it has a motion detector, if someone walks by it will snap a picture. However this feature does not work from me, I am not sure if its the windshield causing issues, the battery dying too soon, or something else.
What I ended up doing is buying a high amp output charger for USB devices and got a micro USB cord and ran it up to the top of my headliner and placed the camera right next to my rear view mirror.
Overall the camera is good. It's not perfect and its kinda cheap but it does the job. Sometimes I get a sneaking suspicion that it is not recording properly when I occasionally put out the memory card to review the video.
Honestly once you set it up there is not much else you need to do. Just make sure you get a decent camera.

It's fairly easy, and I'm not very handy either. Lots of videos out there that can help with installation. I bought one from amazon that has a rear camera as well. Used clear silicone instead of the cheap adhesive for the camera at the back.

Actually, in his defense, it's really alarming how many reviews out there are fake/paid. "Lots" would possibly need to be in the thousands to overcome those.

Yeah I got a transcend one for Xmas which I need to set up, with the Gopro is ha e to turn it on and put it on its mount then press record and sometimes it wouldn't turn on, sometimes it would freeze on the on screen etc. Happy to have this new one.
I remember first seeing dashcam ob this show in the UK called The Gadget Show. She had it hooked to her rear view mirror and had to press a button to start recording when something happened... As though that would ever work in a crash

I use a gopro as a dashcam, but only because I have a gopro already and I haven't bought a proper dashcam yet. It works for now, although I'll never get that mount off my dashboard now I've superglued it in place

Typically, dash cams (good ones anyway) have features gopros wouldn't have like a built in speedometer, GPS logging, and and auto on/off while parked (turns on when motion is detected)

I do and it was a great idea. I've been almost run of the road by tailgaters when I was daring to drive the speed limit and not 15 over. I've considered putting camera on each side too because I've been almost sideswiped several times but the front and rear cameras can't capture that.

I leave it turned on when I go to get repairs/service on my car. The result is a roast from the employees that you wouldn't believe. They all talk about how gay you are for having one. What they don't realize is that I can use it for insurance purposes in a sticky situation. Joke is on them.

I thought about this as well, but if someone runs into your rear, they'll usually be at fault for not keeping proper distance. But I'm a broke graduate student, so my return on investment calculations are pretty lean.

Yes, I over-simplified a little. However, even without dashcams, only a small proportion of claims are fraudulent, and the proportion that end up in court is smaller still. Most of the time there is simply no contest as to whose fault it was (e.g. if you rear-end someone, it's automatically considered your fault ~99% of the time, for not leaving sufficient stopping distance).

I have this camera here . It isn't the greatest but I got it experiment with dash cameras. Here is what I know and how this camera works.
First the camera settings can be adjusted. You can turn off the microphone, you can set the screen to turn off after some time when you start driving to keep your from getting distracted or night time driving. The camera automatically starts recording and when the memory card is full it will write over the oldest video, unless, the video is locked by detecting a bump from it's built in sensor. There are various other settings regarding video brightness, quality/resolution, and few other things. Also this camera can take pictures as well by switching it to camera mode in case of accident its a okay back up camera.
The camera came with a charger/power cord. The camera has a built in battery so that once your turn off the car it will keep recording 1,3,or 5 minutes after turning off the car. Also it has a motion detector, if someone walks by it will snap a picture. However this feature does not work from me, I am not sure if its the windshield causing issues, the battery dying too soon, or something else.
What I ended up doing is buying a high amp output charger for USB devices and got a micro USB cord and ran it up to the top of my headliner and placed the camera right next to my rear view mirror.
Overall the camera is good. It's not perfect and its kinda cheap but it does the job. Sometimes I get a sneaking suspicion that it is not recording properly when I occasionally put out the memory card to review the video.
Honestly once you set it up there is not much else you need to do. Just make sure you get a decent camera.

It's fairly easy, and I'm not very handy either. Lots of videos out there that can help with installation. I bought one from amazon that has a rear camera as well. Used clear silicone instead of the cheap adhesive for the camera at the back.

Actually, in his defense, it's really alarming how many reviews out there are fake/paid. "Lots" would possibly need to be in the thousands to overcome those.

You can find them at any car related shop, usually just suctions to your windscreen and probably only needs an SD card for memory.

I understand where your math comes from here, but the odds would be better than 50%, because it would also work for them in cases when people are working to defraud the insurance companies -- it's not simply a zero-sum game between the two insurance companies.
Also, people may drive and/or behave better when they know their actions are being recorded -- another win/win for the insurance companies (and the drivers, really.)
And even in the cases where their insured is at fault and that's what the dashcam shows ... it still saves them money by reducing the time required to investigate, and it probably helps keep cases out of court (which is expensive) when it's clear what happened.
  (0 children)
Yes, I over-simplified a little. However, even without dashcams, only a small proportion of claims are fraudulent, and the proportion that end up in court is smaller still. Most of the time there is simply no contest as to whose fault it was (e.g. if you rear-end someone, it's automatically considered your fault ~99% of the time, for not leaving sufficient stopping distance).

Of course insurance claims, but they're also useful to you. Ever been in a strange situation in which you wonder how you got your finger stuck in? That weird quiproquo where you don't know what happened and what you didn't see? Watch the tape later and figure it out. It helped me in understanding situations I failed to notice at the right time and not make the same mistake again.

I was thinking of doing a rear-facing one too. I notice a lot of people in my rear-view way too entranced with their phones.

I thought about this as well, but if someone runs into your rear, they'll usually be at fault for not keeping proper distance. But I'm a broke graduate student, so my return on investment calculations are pretty lean.

Shh don't let anyone know! I'll lose my job (seriously through, gopro is overpriced for a dashcam, I use Kapture)
  (2 children)
I use a gopro as a dashcam, but only because I have a gopro already and I haven't bought a proper dashcam yet. It works for now, although I'll never get that mount off my dashboard now I've superglued it in place
  (1 child)
Typically, dash cams (good ones anyway) have features gopros wouldn't have like a built in speedometer, GPS logging, and and auto on/off while parked (turns on when motion is detected)
  (0 children)
Yeah I got a transcend one for Xmas which I need to set up, with the Gopro is ha e to turn it on and put it on its mount then press record and sometimes it wouldn't turn on, sometimes it would freeze on the on screen etc. Happy to have this new one.
I remember first seeing dashcam ob this show in the UK called The Gadget Show. She had it hooked to her rear view mirror and had to press a button to start recording when something happened... As though that would ever work in a crash
  (6 children)
Do you have a rear facing one too? I have been thinking of setting up dash cams in my car as well

If you want something stealthy, I'd go for a mobius or a B118. Or if you just want something cheap, a G1W/C/H. Currently, no good dual cam dashcams, you're better off using two separate ones
  (1 child)
I do and it was a great idea. I've been almost run of the road by tailgaters when I was daring to drive the speed limit and not 15 over. I've considered putting camera on each side too because I've been almost sideswiped several times but the front and rear cameras can't capture that.
  (0 children)
I haven't got around to getting a rear one, I was going to get one that can double as a reversing cam, but that requires a bit more money that I'm short on.

Shh don't let anyone know! I'll lose my job (seriously through, gopro is overpriced for a dashcam, I use Kapture)
  (2 children)
I use a gopro as a dashcam, but only because I have a gopro already and I haven't bought a proper dashcam yet. It works for now, although I'll never get that mount off my dashboard now I've superglued it in place
  (1 child)
Typically, dash cams (good ones anyway) have features gopros wouldn't have like a built in speedometer, GPS logging, and and auto on/off while parked (turns on when motion is detected)
  (0 children)
Yeah I got a transcend one for Xmas which I need to set up, with the Gopro is ha e to turn it on and put it on its mount then press record and sometimes it wouldn't turn on, sometimes it would freeze on the on screen etc. Happy to have this new one.
I remember first seeing dashcam ob this show in the UK called The Gadget Show. She had it hooked to her rear view mirror and had to press a button to start recording when something happened... As though that would ever work in a crash
  (6 children)
Do you have a rear facing one too? I have been thinking of setting up dash cams in my car as well
  (1 child)
I was thinking of doing a rear-facing one too. I notice a lot of people in my rear-view way too entranced with their phones.
  (0 children)
I thought about this as well, but if someone runs into your rear, they'll usually be at fault for not keeping proper distance. But I'm a broke graduate student, so my return on investment calculations are pretty lean.
https://dashcamtalk.com/
If you want something stealthy, I'd go for a mobius or a B118. Or if you just want something cheap, a G1W/C/H. Currently, no good dual cam dashcams, you're better off using two separate ones
  (1 child)
I do and it was a great idea. I've been almost run of the road by tailgaters when I was daring to drive the speed limit and not 15 over. I've considered putting camera on each side too because I've been almost sideswiped several times but the front and rear cameras can't capture that.
  (0 children)
I haven't got around to getting a rear one, I was going to get one that can double as a reversing cam, but that requires a bit more money that I'm short on.
  (0 children)
I can attest to that. Shit battery life, crap night video quality, and annoying to have on a micro USB  tether
  (0 children)
Thats like using Grey Goose in an LIT. You don't need it in 4K, save yourself the trouble and get one of the relatively cameras that are designed for this.

I have this camera here . It isn't the greatest but I got it experiment with dash cameras. Here is what I know and how this camera works.
First the camera settings can be adjusted. You can turn off the microphone, you can set the screen to turn off after some time when you start driving to keep your from getting distracted or night time driving. The camera automatically starts recording and when the memory card is full it will write over the oldest video, unless, the video is locked by detecting a bump from it's built in sensor. There are various other settings regarding video brightness, quality/resolution, and few other things. Also this camera can take pictures as well by switching it to camera mode in case of accident its a okay back up camera.
The camera came with a charger/power cord. The camera has a built in battery so that once your turn off the car it will keep recording 1,3,or 5 minutes after turning off the car. Also it has a motion detector, if someone walks by it will snap a picture. However this feature does not work from me, I am not sure if its the windshield causing issues, the battery dying too soon, or something else.
What I ended up doing is buying a high amp output charger for USB devices and got a micro USB cord and ran it up to the top of my headliner and placed the camera right next to my rear view mirror.
Overall the camera is good. It's not perfect and its kinda cheap but it does the job. Sometimes I get a sneaking suspicion that it is not recording properly when I occasionally put out the memory card to review the video.
Honestly once you set it up there is not much else you need to do. Just make sure you get a decent camera.
  (0 children)
You can find them at any car related shop, usually just suctions to your windscreen and probably only needs an SD card for memory.
  (0 children)
It's fairly easy, and I'm not very handy either. Lots of videos out there that can help with installation. I bought one from amazon that has a rear camera as well. Used clear silicone instead of the cheap adhesive for the camera at the back.

Actually, in his defense, it's really alarming how many reviews out there are fake/paid. "Lots" would possibly need to be in the thousands to overcome those.

If it's your own dashcam, you can just delete the footage and not let the other party know you have a dashcam.
  (7 children)
  (4 children)
  (2 children)
How hard would it be to delete the recording and claim you forgot to turn it on before you drove that day?
  (1 child)
  (0 children)
That's if you're going in front of the court for a civil or criminal case. Most insurance claims fortunately don't go through justice.
  (3 children)
This is the main reason that insurers don't want them made mandatory. Half the time it would work against them, and worse, it would reduce the proportion of incidents being settled on a 50-50 basis with both parties at fault (more profitable for both insurance companies overall, as everyone's premiums go up).
I understand where your math comes from here, but the odds would be better than 50%, because it would also work for them in cases when people are working to defraud the insurance companies -- it's not simply a zero-sum game between the two insurance companies.
Also, people may drive and/or behave better when they know their actions are being recorded -- another win/win for the insurance companies (and the drivers, really.)
And even in the cases where their insured is at fault and that's what the dashcam shows ... it still saves them money by reducing the time required to investigate, and it probably helps keep cases out of court (which is expensive) when it's clear what happened.
  (0 children)
Yes, I over-simplified a little. However, even without dashcams, only a small proportion of claims are fraudulent, and the proportion that end up in court is smaller still. Most of the time there is simply no contest as to whose fault it was (e.g. if you rear-end someone, it's automatically considered your fault ~99% of the time, for not leaving sufficient stopping distance).
  (4 children)
I love my G1W. I haven't had to use it to prove innocence yet, but I have used it a few times to show people the asshats I encounter while driving.
  (3 children)
Is there a difference between the types? I'm seeing one "E Prance" on Amazon for £40, and a load of similar looking no name ones for half that price!
  (2 children)
  (0 children)
Unless you're a crappy driver.  Then you don't want a dashcam.
If you're a crappy driver, your dashcam is more likely to be used against you than for you.  If the other party or the police notices that you have one ... they'll ask for the footage, and you really don't have any reason to refuse the request, and if it goes to court -- it'll be subpoenaed.
  (0 children)
I leave it turned on when I go to get repairs/service on my car. The result is a roast from the employees that you wouldn't believe. They all talk about how gay you are for having one. What they don't realize is that I can use it for insurance purposes in a sticky situation. Joke is on them.

How do they work exactly? Like do they continuously record or do they only activate after a certain criteria? How large an SD card should I have?
  (0 children)
They overwrite the beginning of the record every once in a while. There's a button you can press shortly after an event so it never gets deleted. A 32gb SD card (pretty standard today) will get you plenty of space.
  (1 child)
Of course insurance claims, but they're also useful to you. Ever been in a strange situation in which you wonder how you got your finger stuck in? That weird quiproquo where you don't know what happened and what you didn't see? Watch the tape later and figure it out. It helped me in understanding situations I failed to notice at the right time and not make the same mistake again.
  (1 child)
Well I've been driving for 16 years and haven't needed one. Not saying they come in handy if needed but it's not like an absolute necessity to drive.
  (0 children)
I'm in a similar situation. But a while back I had someone, run a red light clipping the front of my car, I decided to get one after then.

If my car had a Hayes manual so I could run the power for one, I'd be all over that.

I just looked on Amazon, seems highly rated ones are less than $100 and have a small footprint. I guess I should finally get one. I think front and rear are good idea.
  (0 children)
No they aren't. That law restricted a very specific subset of video accident recorders which didn't include the dash cams OP is talking about.

I haven't got around to getting a rear one, I was going to get one that can double as a reversing cam, but that requires a bit more money that I'm short on.

I just looked on Amazon, seems highly rated ones are less than $100 and have a small footprint. I guess I should finally get one. I think front and rear are good idea.
  (0 children)
No they aren't. That law restricted a very specific subset of video accident recorders which didn't include the dash cams OP is talking about.
  (1 child)
  (0 children)
  (1 child)
Well I've been driving for 16 years and haven't needed one. Not saying they come in handy if needed but it's not like an absolute necessity to drive.
  (0 children)
I'm in a similar situation. But a while back I had someone, run a red light clipping the front of my car, I decided to get one after then.
  (0 children)
Thats like using Grey Goose in an LIT. You don't need it in 4K, save yourself the trouble and get one of the relatively cameras that are designed for this.
  (11 children)
Shh don't let anyone know! I'll lose my job (seriously through, gopro is overpriced for a dashcam, I use Kapture)
  (2 children)
I use a gopro as a dashcam, but only because I have a gopro already and I haven't bought a proper dashcam yet. It works for now, although I'll never get that mount off my dashboard now I've superglued it in place
  (1 child)
Typically, dash cams (good ones anyway) have features gopros wouldn't have like a built in speedometer, GPS logging, and and auto on/off while parked (turns on when motion is detected)
  (0 children)
Yeah I got a transcend one for Xmas which I need to set up, with the Gopro is ha e to turn it on and put it on its mount then press record and sometimes it wouldn't turn on, sometimes it would freeze on the on screen etc. Happy to have this new one.
I remember first seeing dashcam ob this show in the UK called The Gadget Show. She had it hooked to her rear view mirror and had to press a button to start recording when something happened... As though that would ever work in a crash
  (6 children)
Do you have a rear facing one too? I have been thinking of setting up dash cams in my car as well
  (1 child)
I was thinking of doing a rear-facing one too. I notice a lot of people in my rear-view way too entranced with their phones.
  (0 children)
I thought about this as well, but if someone runs into your rear, they'll usually be at fault for not keeping proper distance. But I'm a broke graduate student, so my return on investment calculations are pretty lean.
  (1 child)
I do and it was a great idea. I've been almost run of the road by tailgaters when I was daring to drive the speed limit and not 15 over. I've considered putting camera on each side too because I've been almost sideswiped several times but the front and rear cameras can't capture that.
https://dashcamtalk.com/
If you want something stealthy, I'd go for a mobius or a B118. Or if you just want something cheap, a G1W/C/H. Currently, no good dual cam dashcams, you're better off using two separate ones
  (0 children)
I haven't got around to getting a rear one, I was going to get one that can double as a reversing cam, but that requires a bit more money that I'm short on.
  (0 children)
I can attest to that. Shit battery life, crap night video quality, and annoying to have on a micro USB  tether

Of course insurance claims, but they're also useful to you. Ever been in a strange situation in which you wonder how you got your finger stuck in? That weird quiproquo where you don't know what happened and what you didn't see? Watch the tape later and figure it out. It helped me in understanding situations I failed to notice at the right time and not make the same mistake again.
  (9 children)
If it's your own dashcam, you can just delete the footage and not let the other party know you have a dashcam.
  (7 children)
  (4 children)
  (2 children)
How hard would it be to delete the recording and claim you forgot to turn it on before you drove that day?
  (1 child)
  (0 children)
That's if you're going in front of the court for a civil or criminal case. Most insurance claims fortunately don't go through justice.
  (1 child)
  (3 children)
This is the main reason that insurers don't want them made mandatory. Half the time it would work against them, and worse, it would reduce the proportion of incidents being settled on a 50-50 basis with both parties at fault (more profitable for both insurance companies overall, as everyone's premiums go up).
I understand where your math comes from here, but the odds would be better than 50%, because it would also work for them in cases when people are working to defraud the insurance companies -- it's not simply a zero-sum game between the two insurance companies.
Also, people may drive and/or behave better when they know their actions are being recorded -- another win/win for the insurance companies (and the drivers, really.)
And even in the cases where their insured is at fault and that's what the dashcam shows ... it still saves them money by reducing the time required to investigate, and it probably helps keep cases out of court (which is expensive) when it's clear what happened.
  (0 children)
Yes, I over-simplified a little. However, even without dashcams, only a small proportion of claims are fraudulent, and the proportion that end up in court is smaller still. Most of the time there is simply no contest as to whose fault it was (e.g. if you rear-end someone, it's automatically considered your fault ~99% of the time, for not leaving sufficient stopping distance).

yea thats true... i was kinda just being an ass because its the only way i can make make myself feel better about my abusive father.
  (5 children)

Actually, in his defense, it's really alarming how many reviews out there are fake/paid. "Lots" would possibly need to be in the thousands to overcome those.
  (0 children)
You can find them at any car related shop, usually just suctions to your windscreen and probably only needs an SD card for memory.
  (0 children)
It's fairly easy, and I'm not very handy either. Lots of videos out there that can help with installation. I bought one from amazon that has a rear camera as well. Used clear silicone instead of the cheap adhesive for the camera at the back.
  (0 children)
I have this camera here . It isn't the greatest but I got it experiment with dash cameras. Here is what I know and how this camera works.
First the camera settings can be adjusted. You can turn off the microphone, you can set the screen to turn off after some time when you start driving to keep your from getting distracted or night time driving. The camera automatically starts recording and when the memory card is full it will write over the oldest video, unless, the video is locked by detecting a bump from it's built in sensor. There are various other settings regarding video brightness, quality/resolution, and few other things. Also this camera can take pictures as well by switching it to camera mode in case of accident its a okay back up camera.
The camera came with a charger/power cord. The camera has a built in battery so that once your turn off the car it will keep recording 1,3,or 5 minutes after turning off the car. Also it has a motion detector, if someone walks by it will snap a picture. However this feature does not work from me, I am not sure if its the windshield causing issues, the battery dying too soon, or something else.
What I ended up doing is buying a high amp output charger for USB devices and got a micro USB cord and ran it up to the top of my headliner and placed the camera right next to my rear view mirror.
Overall the camera is good. It's not perfect and its kinda cheap but it does the job. Sometimes I get a sneaking suspicion that it is not recording properly when I occasionally put out the memory card to review the video.
Honestly once you set it up there is not much else you need to do. Just make sure you get a decent camera.

I love my G1W. I haven't had to use it to prove innocence yet, but I have used it a few times to show people the asshats I encounter while driving.
  (3 children)
Is there a difference between the types? I'm seeing one "E Prance" on Amazon for £40, and a load of similar looking no name ones for half that price!
  (2 children)
  (8 children)
If my car had a Hayes manual so I could run the power for one, I'd be all over that.
  (3 children)
  (2 children)
Use 12V/ground at harness behind socket! I doubt you need a haynes for that, car specific forums are packed with pics
  (1 child)
  (0 children)
  (1 child)
How do they work exactly? Like do they continuously record or do they only activate after a certain criteria? How large an SD card should I have?
  (0 children)
They overwrite the beginning of the record every once in a while. There's a button you can press shortly after an event so it never gets deleted. A 32gb SD card (pretty standard today) will get you plenty of space.
  (0 children)
I leave it turned on when I go to get repairs/service on my car. The result is a roast from the employees that you wouldn't believe. They all talk about how gay you are for having one. What they don't realize is that I can use it for insurance purposes in a sticky situation. Joke is on them.
Unless you're a crappy driver.  Then you don't want a dashcam.
If you're a crappy driver, your dashcam is more likely to be used against you than for you.  If the other party or the police notices that you have one ... they'll ask for the footage, and you really don't have any reason to refuse the request, and if it goes to court -- it'll be subpoenaed.

Shh don't let anyone know! I'll lose my job (seriously through, gopro is overpriced for a dashcam, I use Kapture)
  (2 children)
I use a gopro as a dashcam, but only because I have a gopro already and I haven't bought a proper dashcam yet. It works for now, although I'll never get that mount off my dashboard now I've superglued it in place
  (1 child)
Typically, dash cams (good ones anyway) have features gopros wouldn't have like a built in speedometer, GPS logging, and and auto on/off while parked (turns on when motion is detected)
  (0 children)
Yeah I got a transcend one for Xmas which I need to set up, with the Gopro is ha e to turn it on and put it on its mount then press record and sometimes it wouldn't turn on, sometimes it would freeze on the on screen etc. Happy to have this new one.
I remember first seeing dashcam ob this show in the UK called The Gadget Show. She had it hooked to her rear view mirror and had to press a button to start recording when something happened... As though that would ever work in a crash
  (6 children)
Do you have a rear facing one too? I have been thinking of setting up dash cams in my car as well
  (1 child)
I was thinking of doing a rear-facing one too. I notice a lot of people in my rear-view way too entranced with their phones.
  (0 children)
I thought about this as well, but if someone runs into your rear, they'll usually be at fault for not keeping proper distance. But I'm a broke graduate student, so my return on investment calculations are pretty lean.
  (1 child)
I do and it was a great idea. I've been almost run of the road by tailgaters when I was daring to drive the speed limit and not 15 over. I've considered putting camera on each side too because I've been almost sideswiped several times but the front and rear cameras can't capture that.
https://dashcamtalk.com/
If you want something stealthy, I'd go for a mobius or a B118. Or if you just want something cheap, a G1W/C/H. Currently, no good dual cam dashcams, you're better off using two separate ones
  (0 children)
I haven't got around to getting a rear one, I was going to get one that can double as a reversing cam, but that requires a bit more money that I'm short on.
  (0 children)
Thats like using Grey Goose in an LIT. You don't need it in 4K, save yourself the trouble and get one of the relatively cameras that are designed for this.
  (0 children)
I can attest to that. Shit battery life, crap night video quality, and annoying to have on a micro USB  tether

No they aren't. That law restricted a very specific subset of video accident recorders which didn't include the dash cams OP is talking about.

That's if you're going in front of the court for a civil or criminal case. Most insurance claims fortunately don't go through justice.

How do they work exactly? Like do they continuously record or do they only activate after a certain criteria? How large an SD card should I have?
  (0 children)
They overwrite the beginning of the record every once in a while. There's a button you can press shortly after an event so it never gets deleted. A 32gb SD card (pretty standard today) will get you plenty of space.

If it's your own dashcam, you can just delete the footage and not let the other party know you have a dashcam.

That's if you're going in front of the court for a civil or criminal case. Most insurance claims fortunately don't go through justice.

How hard would it be to delete the recording and claim you forgot to turn it on before you drove that day?
  (1 child)
  (3 children)
This is the main reason that insurers don't want them made mandatory. Half the time it would work against them, and worse, it would reduce the proportion of incidents being settled on a 50-50 basis with both parties at fault (more profitable for both insurance companies overall, as everyone's premiums go up).
I understand where your math comes from here, but the odds would be better than 50%, because it would also work for them in cases when people are working to defraud the insurance companies -- it's not simply a zero-sum game between the two insurance companies.
Also, people may drive and/or behave better when they know their actions are being recorded -- another win/win for the insurance companies (and the drivers, really.)
And even in the cases where their insured is at fault and that's what the dashcam shows ... it still saves them money by reducing the time required to investigate, and it probably helps keep cases out of court (which is expensive) when it's clear what happened.
  (0 children)
Yes, I over-simplified a little. However, even without dashcams, only a small proportion of claims are fraudulent, and the proportion that end up in court is smaller still. Most of the time there is simply no contest as to whose fault it was (e.g. if you rear-end someone, it's automatically considered your fault ~99% of the time, for not leaving sufficient stopping distance).

I use a gopro as a dashcam, but only because I have a gopro already and I haven't bought a proper dashcam yet. It works for now, although I'll never get that mount off my dashboard now I've superglued it in place
  (1 child)
Typically, dash cams (good ones anyway) have features gopros wouldn't have like a built in speedometer, GPS logging, and and auto on/off while parked (turns on when motion is detected)

Yeah I got a transcend one for Xmas which I need to set up, with the Gopro is ha e to turn it on and put it on its mount then press record and sometimes it wouldn't turn on, sometimes it would freeze on the on screen etc. Happy to have this new one.
I remember first seeing dashcam ob this show in the UK called The Gadget Show. She had it hooked to her rear view mirror and had to press a button to start recording when something happened... As though that would ever work in a crash

Actually, in his defense, it's really alarming how many reviews out there are fake/paid. "Lots" would possibly need to be in the thousands to overcome those.

I leave it turned on when I go to get repairs/service on my car. The result is a roast from the employees that you wouldn't believe. They all talk about how gay you are for having one. What they don't realize is that I can use it for insurance purposes in a sticky situation. Joke is on them.

Is there a difference between the types? I'm seeing one "E Prance" on Amazon for £40, and a load of similar looking no name ones for half that price!

I was thinking of doing a rear-facing one too. I notice a lot of people in my rear-view way too entranced with their phones.

I thought about this as well, but if someone runs into your rear, they'll usually be at fault for not keeping proper distance. But I'm a broke graduate student, so my return on investment calculations are pretty lean.

Unless you're a crappy driver.  Then you don't want a dashcam.
If you're a crappy driver, your dashcam is more likely to be used against you than for you.  If the other party or the police notices that you have one ... they'll ask for the footage, and you really don't have any reason to refuse the request, and if it goes to court -- it'll be subpoenaed.

It's fairly easy, and I'm not very handy either. Lots of videos out there that can help with installation. I bought one from amazon that has a rear camera as well. Used clear silicone instead of the cheap adhesive for the camera at the back.

I just looked on Amazon, seems highly rated ones are less than $100 and have a small footprint. I guess I should finally get one. I think front and rear are good idea.

I use a gopro as a dashcam, but only because I have a gopro already and I haven't bought a proper dashcam yet. It works for now, although I'll never get that mount off my dashboard now I've superglued it in place
  (1 child)
Typically, dash cams (good ones anyway) have features gopros wouldn't have like a built in speedometer, GPS logging, and and auto on/off while parked (turns on when motion is detected)

Yeah I got a transcend one for Xmas which I need to set up, with the Gopro is ha e to turn it on and put it on its mount then press record and sometimes it wouldn't turn on, sometimes it would freeze on the on screen etc. Happy to have this new one.
I remember first seeing dashcam ob this show in the UK called The Gadget Show. She had it hooked to her rear view mirror and had to press a button to start recording when something happened... As though that would ever work in a crash

If you want something stealthy, I'd go for a mobius or a B118. Or if you just want something cheap, a G1W/C/H. Currently, no good dual cam dashcams, you're better off using two separate ones

You can find them at any car related shop, usually just suctions to your windscreen and probably only needs an SD card for memory.

yea thats true... i was kinda just being an ass because its the only way i can make make myself feel better about my abusive father.

Actually, in his defense, it's really alarming how many reviews out there are fake/paid. "Lots" would possibly need to be in the thousands to overcome those.

It's fairly easy, and I'm not very handy either. Lots of videos out there that can help with installation. I bought one from amazon that has a rear camera as well. Used clear silicone instead of the cheap adhesive for the camera at the back.
  (0 children)
I have this camera here . It isn't the greatest but I got it experiment with dash cameras. Here is what I know and how this camera works.
First the camera settings can be adjusted. You can turn off the microphone, you can set the screen to turn off after some time when you start driving to keep your from getting distracted or night time driving. The camera automatically starts recording and when the memory card is full it will write over the oldest video, unless, the video is locked by detecting a bump from it's built in sensor. There are various other settings regarding video brightness, quality/resolution, and few other things. Also this camera can take pictures as well by switching it to camera mode in case of accident its a okay back up camera.
The camera came with a charger/power cord. The camera has a built in battery so that once your turn off the car it will keep recording 1,3,or 5 minutes after turning off the car. Also it has a motion detector, if someone walks by it will snap a picture. However this feature does not work from me, I am not sure if its the windshield causing issues, the battery dying too soon, or something else.
What I ended up doing is buying a high amp output charger for USB devices and got a micro USB cord and ran it up to the top of my headliner and placed the camera right next to my rear view mirror.
Overall the camera is good. It's not perfect and its kinda cheap but it does the job. Sometimes I get a sneaking suspicion that it is not recording properly when I occasionally put out the memory card to review the video.
Honestly once you set it up there is not much else you need to do. Just make sure you get a decent camera.

I just looked on Amazon, seems highly rated ones are less than $100 and have a small footprint. I guess I should finally get one. I think front and rear are good idea.

Thats like using Grey Goose in an LIT. You don't need it in 4K, save yourself the trouble and get one of the relatively cameras that are designed for this.

Shh don't let anyone know! I'll lose my job (seriously through, gopro is overpriced for a dashcam, I use Kapture)
  (2 children)
I use a gopro as a dashcam, but only because I have a gopro already and I haven't bought a proper dashcam yet. It works for now, although I'll never get that mount off my dashboard now I've superglued it in place
  (1 child)
Typically, dash cams (good ones anyway) have features gopros wouldn't have like a built in speedometer, GPS logging, and and auto on/off while parked (turns on when motion is detected)
  (0 children)
Yeah I got a transcend one for Xmas which I need to set up, with the Gopro is ha e to turn it on and put it on its mount then press record and sometimes it wouldn't turn on, sometimes it would freeze on the on screen etc. Happy to have this new one.
I remember first seeing dashcam ob this show in the UK called The Gadget Show. She had it hooked to her rear view mirror and had to press a button to start recording when something happened... As though that would ever work in a crash
  (6 children)
Do you have a rear facing one too? I have been thinking of setting up dash cams in my car as well
  (1 child)
I was thinking of doing a rear-facing one too. I notice a lot of people in my rear-view way too entranced with their phones.
  (0 children)
I thought about this as well, but if someone runs into your rear, they'll usually be at fault for not keeping proper distance. But I'm a broke graduate student, so my return on investment calculations are pretty lean.
  (1 child)
I do and it was a great idea. I've been almost run of the road by tailgaters when I was daring to drive the speed limit and not 15 over. I've considered putting camera on each side too because I've been almost sideswiped several times but the front and rear cameras can't capture that.

If you want something stealthy, I'd go for a mobius or a B118. Or if you just want something cheap, a G1W/C/H. Currently, no good dual cam dashcams, you're better off using two separate ones
  (0 children)
I haven't got around to getting a rear one, I was going to get one that can double as a reversing cam, but that requires a bit more money that I'm short on.

I can attest to that. Shit battery life, crap night video quality, and annoying to have on a micro USB  tether

This is the main reason that insurers don't want them made mandatory. Half the time it would work against them, and worse, it would reduce the proportion of incidents being settled on a 50-50 basis with both parties at fault (more profitable for both insurance companies overall, as everyone's premiums go up).
I understand where your math comes from here, but the odds would be better than 50%, because it would also work for them in cases when people are working to defraud the insurance companies -- it's not simply a zero-sum game between the two insurance companies.
Also, people may drive and/or behave better when they know their actions are being recorded -- another win/win for the insurance companies (and the drivers, really.)
And even in the cases where their insured is at fault and that's what the dashcam shows ... it still saves them money by reducing the time required to investigate, and it probably helps keep cases out of court (which is expensive) when it's clear what happened.
  (0 children)
Yes, I over-simplified a little. However, even without dashcams, only a small proportion of claims are fraudulent, and the proportion that end up in court is smaller still. Most of the time there is simply no contest as to whose fault it was (e.g. if you rear-end someone, it's automatically considered your fault ~99% of the time, for not leaving sufficient stopping distance).

I was thinking of doing a rear-facing one too. I notice a lot of people in my rear-view way too entranced with their phones.

I thought about this as well, but if someone runs into your rear, they'll usually be at fault for not keeping proper distance. But I'm a broke graduate student, so my return on investment calculations are pretty lean.

Yeah I got a transcend one for Xmas which I need to set up, with the Gopro is ha e to turn it on and put it on its mount then press record and sometimes it wouldn't turn on, sometimes it would freeze on the on screen etc. Happy to have this new one.
I remember first seeing dashcam ob this show in the UK called The Gadget Show. She had it hooked to her rear view mirror and had to press a button to start recording when something happened... As though that would ever work in a crash

I love my G1W. I haven't had to use it to prove innocence yet, but I have used it a few times to show people the asshats I encounter while driving.

Is there a difference between the types? I'm seeing one "E Prance" on Amazon for £40, and a load of similar looking no name ones for half that price!

I just looked on Amazon, seems highly rated ones are less than $100 and have a small footprint. I guess I should finally get one. I think front and rear are good idea.

Yeah I got a transcend one for Xmas which I need to set up, with the Gopro is ha e to turn it on and put it on its mount then press record and sometimes it wouldn't turn on, sometimes it would freeze on the on screen etc. Happy to have this new one.
I remember first seeing dashcam ob this show in the UK called The Gadget Show. She had it hooked to her rear view mirror and had to press a button to start recording when something happened... As though that would ever work in a crash

Of course insurance claims, but they're also useful to you. Ever been in a strange situation in which you wonder how you got your finger stuck in? That weird quiproquo where you don't know what happened and what you didn't see? Watch the tape later and figure it out. It helped me in understanding situations I failed to notice at the right time and not make the same mistake again.

That's if you're going in front of the court for a civil or criminal case. Most insurance claims fortunately don't go through justice.

They overwrite the beginning of the record every once in a while. There's a button you can press shortly after an event so it never gets deleted. A 32gb SD card (pretty standard today) will get you plenty of space.

I have this camera here . It isn't the greatest but I got it experiment with dash cameras. Here is what I know and how this camera works.
First the camera settings can be adjusted. You can turn off the microphone, you can set the screen to turn off after some time when you start driving to keep your from getting distracted or night time driving. The camera automatically starts recording and when the memory card is full it will write over the oldest video, unless, the video is locked by detecting a bump from it's built in sensor. There are various other settings regarding video brightness, quality/resolution, and few other things. Also this camera can take pictures as well by switching it to camera mode in case of accident its a okay back up camera.
The camera came with a charger/power cord. The camera has a built in battery so that once your turn off the car it will keep recording 1,3,or 5 minutes after turning off the car. Also it has a motion detector, if someone walks by it will snap a picture. However this feature does not work from me, I am not sure if its the windshield causing issues, the battery dying too soon, or something else.
What I ended up doing is buying a high amp output charger for USB devices and got a micro USB cord and ran it up to the top of my headliner and placed the camera right next to my rear view mirror.
Overall the camera is good. It's not perfect and its kinda cheap but it does the job. Sometimes I get a sneaking suspicion that it is not recording properly when I occasionally put out the memory card to review the video.
Honestly once you set it up there is not much else you need to do. Just make sure you get a decent camera.

If it's your own dashcam, you can just delete the footage and not let the other party know you have a dashcam.

How hard would it be to delete the recording and claim you forgot to turn it on before you drove that day?

That's if you're going in front of the court for a civil or criminal case. Most insurance claims fortunately don't go through justice.
  (1 child)
  (3 children)
This is the main reason that insurers don't want them made mandatory. Half the time it would work against them, and worse, it would reduce the proportion of incidents being settled on a 50-50 basis with both parties at fault (more profitable for both insurance companies overall, as everyone's premiums go up).
I understand where your math comes from here, but the odds would be better than 50%, because it would also work for them in cases when people are working to defraud the insurance companies -- it's not simply a zero-sum game between the two insurance companies.
Also, people may drive and/or behave better when they know their actions are being recorded -- another win/win for the insurance companies (and the drivers, really.)
And even in the cases where their insured is at fault and that's what the dashcam shows ... it still saves them money by reducing the time required to investigate, and it probably helps keep cases out of court (which is expensive) when it's clear what happened.
  (0 children)
Yes, I over-simplified a little. However, even without dashcams, only a small proportion of claims are fraudulent, and the proportion that end up in court is smaller still. Most of the time there is simply no contest as to whose fault it was (e.g. if you rear-end someone, it's automatically considered your fault ~99% of the time, for not leaving sufficient stopping distance).

Actually, in his defense, it's really alarming how many reviews out there are fake/paid. "Lots" would possibly need to be in the thousands to overcome those.

Unless you're a crappy driver.  Then you don't want a dashcam.
If you're a crappy driver, your dashcam is more likely to be used against you than for you.  If the other party or the police notices that you have one ... they'll ask for the footage, and you really don't have any reason to refuse the request, and if it goes to court -- it'll be subpoenaed.

Well I've been driving for 16 years and haven't needed one. Not saying they come in handy if needed but it's not like an absolute necessity to drive.
  (0 children)
I'm in a similar situation. But a while back I had someone, run a red light clipping the front of my car, I decided to get one after then.
  (1 child)
Of course insurance claims, but they're also useful to you. Ever been in a strange situation in which you wonder how you got your finger stuck in? That weird quiproquo where you don't know what happened and what you didn't see? Watch the tape later and figure it out. It helped me in understanding situations I failed to notice at the right time and not make the same mistake again.

No they aren't. That law restricted a very specific subset of video accident recorders which didn't include the dash cams OP is talking about.

I leave it turned on when I go to get repairs/service on my car. The result is a roast from the employees that you wouldn't believe. They all talk about how gay you are for having one. What they don't realize is that I can use it for insurance purposes in a sticky situation. Joke is on them.

I have this camera here . It isn't the greatest but I got it experiment with dash cameras. Here is what I know and how this camera works.
First the camera settings can be adjusted. You can turn off the microphone, you can set the screen to turn off after some time when you start driving to keep your from getting distracted or night time driving. The camera automatically starts recording and when the memory card is full it will write over the oldest video, unless, the video is locked by detecting a bump from it's built in sensor. There are various other settings regarding video brightness, quality/resolution, and few other things. Also this camera can take pictures as well by switching it to camera mode in case of accident its a okay back up camera.
The camera came with a charger/power cord. The camera has a built in battery so that once your turn off the car it will keep recording 1,3,or 5 minutes after turning off the car. Also it has a motion detector, if someone walks by it will snap a picture. However this feature does not work from me, I am not sure if its the windshield causing issues, the battery dying too soon, or something else.
What I ended up doing is buying a high amp output charger for USB devices and got a micro USB cord and ran it up to the top of my headliner and placed the camera right next to my rear view mirror.
Overall the camera is good. It's not perfect and its kinda cheap but it does the job. Sometimes I get a sneaking suspicion that it is not recording properly when I occasionally put out the memory card to review the video.
Honestly once you set it up there is not much else you need to do. Just make sure you get a decent camera.
  (0 children)
It's fairly easy, and I'm not very handy either. Lots of videos out there that can help with installation. I bought one from amazon that has a rear camera as well. Used clear silicone instead of the cheap adhesive for the camera at the back.

You can find them at any car related shop, usually just suctions to your windscreen and probably only needs an SD card for memory.

Shh don't let anyone know! I'll lose my job (seriously through, gopro is overpriced for a dashcam, I use Kapture)
  (2 children)
I use a gopro as a dashcam, but only because I have a gopro already and I haven't bought a proper dashcam yet. It works for now, although I'll never get that mount off my dashboard now I've superglued it in place
  (1 child)
Typically, dash cams (good ones anyway) have features gopros wouldn't have like a built in speedometer, GPS logging, and and auto on/off while parked (turns on when motion is detected)
  (0 children)
Yeah I got a transcend one for Xmas which I need to set up, with the Gopro is ha e to turn it on and put it on its mount then press record and sometimes it wouldn't turn on, sometimes it would freeze on the on screen etc. Happy to have this new one.
I remember first seeing dashcam ob this show in the UK called The Gadget Show. She had it hooked to her rear view mirror and had to press a button to start recording when something happened... As though that would ever work in a crash
  (6 children)
Do you have a rear facing one too? I have been thinking of setting up dash cams in my car as well
  (1 child)
I was thinking of doing a rear-facing one too. I notice a lot of people in my rear-view way too entranced with their phones.
  (0 children)
I thought about this as well, but if someone runs into your rear, they'll usually be at fault for not keeping proper distance. But I'm a broke graduate student, so my return on investment calculations are pretty lean.
https://dashcamtalk.com/
If you want something stealthy, I'd go for a mobius or a B118. Or if you just want something cheap, a G1W/C/H. Currently, no good dual cam dashcams, you're better off using two separate ones
  (1 child)
I do and it was a great idea. I've been almost run of the road by tailgaters when I was daring to drive the speed limit and not 15 over. I've considered putting camera on each side too because I've been almost sideswiped several times but the front and rear cameras can't capture that.
  (0 children)
I haven't got around to getting a rear one, I was going to get one that can double as a reversing cam, but that requires a bit more money that I'm short on.
  (0 children)
I can attest to that. Shit battery life, crap night video quality, and annoying to have on a micro USB  tether
  (0 children)
Thats like using Grey Goose in an LIT. You don't need it in 4K, save yourself the trouble and get one of the relatively cameras that are designed for this.
  (1 child)
How do they work exactly? Like do they continuously record or do they only activate after a certain criteria? How large an SD card should I have?
  (0 children)
They overwrite the beginning of the record every once in a while. There's a button you can press shortly after an event so it never gets deleted. A 32gb SD card (pretty standard today) will get you plenty of space.

I just looked on Amazon, seems highly rated ones are less than $100 and have a small footprint. I guess I should finally get one. I think front and rear are good idea.

Actually, in his defense, it's really alarming how many reviews out there are fake/paid. "Lots" would possibly need to be in the thousands to overcome those.

I just looked on Amazon, seems highly rated ones are less than $100 and have a small footprint. I guess I should finally get one. I think front and rear are good idea.

I have this camera here . It isn't the greatest but I got it experiment with dash cameras. Here is what I know and how this camera works.
First the camera settings can be adjusted. You can turn off the microphone, you can set the screen to turn off after some time when you start driving to keep your from getting distracted or night time driving. The camera automatically starts recording and when the memory card is full it will write over the oldest video, unless, the video is locked by detecting a bump from it's built in sensor. There are various other settings regarding video brightness, quality/resolution, and few other things. Also this camera can take pictures as well by switching it to camera mode in case of accident its a okay back up camera.
The camera came with a charger/power cord. The camera has a built in battery so that once your turn off the car it will keep recording 1,3,or 5 minutes after turning off the car. Also it has a motion detector, if someone walks by it will snap a picture. However this feature does not work from me, I am not sure if its the windshield causing issues, the battery dying too soon, or something else.
What I ended up doing is buying a high amp output charger for USB devices and got a micro USB cord and ran it up to the top of my headliner and placed the camera right next to my rear view mirror.
Overall the camera is good. It's not perfect and its kinda cheap but it does the job. Sometimes I get a sneaking suspicion that it is not recording properly when I occasionally put out the memory card to review the video.
Honestly once you set it up there is not much else you need to do. Just make sure you get a decent camera.

This is the main reason that insurers don't want them made mandatory. Half the time it would work against them, and worse, it would reduce the proportion of incidents being settled on a 50-50 basis with both parties at fault (more profitable for both insurance companies overall, as everyone's premiums go up).
I understand where your math comes from here, but the odds would be better than 50%, because it would also work for them in cases when people are working to defraud the insurance companies -- it's not simply a zero-sum game between the two insurance companies.
Also, people may drive and/or behave better when they know their actions are being recorded -- another win/win for the insurance companies (and the drivers, really.)
And even in the cases where their insured is at fault and that's what the dashcam shows ... it still saves them money by reducing the time required to investigate, and it probably helps keep cases out of court (which is expensive) when it's clear what happened.
  (0 children)
Yes, I over-simplified a little. However, even without dashcams, only a small proportion of claims are fraudulent, and the proportion that end up in court is smaller still. Most of the time there is simply no contest as to whose fault it was (e.g. if you rear-end someone, it's automatically considered your fault ~99% of the time, for not leaving sufficient stopping distance).

I was thinking of doing a rear-facing one too. I notice a lot of people in my rear-view way too entranced with their phones.

I thought about this as well, but if someone runs into your rear, they'll usually be at fault for not keeping proper distance. But I'm a broke graduate student, so my return on investment calculations are pretty lean.
